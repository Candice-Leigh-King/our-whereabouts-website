      If you would like that awesome scroll feature that happens when someone
      clicks on a link in the navigation, then you'll need to add a page id.
      The page id can be added in the below box labeled "link". Your id is a
      short word describing the section it is leading to. For example- about.
      If you don't want this section to link from the navigation, you can
      simply leave it out.

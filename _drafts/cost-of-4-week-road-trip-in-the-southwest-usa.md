      <p>Things that didn't make it into this calculation are the flights,
      travel insurance because it's different in every destination, and shopping
      since shopping is so much cheaper in the US compared to Israel, we stoke
      up while we are in the US.</p><p>•Travel Insurance: $312.89 | $156.44

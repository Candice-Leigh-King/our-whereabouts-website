      <p>Arches National Park is one of Utah's Mighty 5 which contains the
      world’s largest concentration of natural sandstone arches. There are over
      2,000 documented arches in the park, plus pinnacles, balanced rocks, fins,
      and other geologic formations. Besides Arches, the park offers many
      viewpoints and great trails.&nbsp;</p>

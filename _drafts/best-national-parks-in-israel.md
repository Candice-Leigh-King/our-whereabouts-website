      <h3><strong>1. BEIT GUVRIN CAVES</strong></h3><p>Beit Guvrin is not only a
      national park but also a UNESCO world heritage site Located not too far
      from Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fairly large complex, which includes
      about 5 different sites with the main ones being Tel Maresha, Maresha
      caves, The northern city complex, and the reconstructed ancient wine press
      and olive press.</p><p>The highlight is the caves that are spectacular in
      beauty but apart from the caves the area is very beautiful and there are
      great trails, beautiful ruins, and interesting history.</p><h3>Things you
      should know before you go:</h3><ul><li>Admission costs: Adult $
      7.5</li><li>Transportation: Because the compound is large inside, you
      travel by car from place to place and park near each site.</li><li>When
      entering you get a very understandable map to use.</li><li>The site is
      open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</li><li>it is recommended to arrive
      in the middle of the week, early from a place to enjoy it
      properly.</li><li>in winter, the place is much greener but it should be
      taken into account that the caves close for safety reasons, so it is
      recommended to check before if the caves open.</li></ul>

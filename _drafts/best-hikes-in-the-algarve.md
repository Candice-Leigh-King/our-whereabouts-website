      <h3><strong>The Seven Hanging Valleys Trail:</strong></h3><ul><li>Region:
      Lagoa, South Coast</li><li>Distance: 12km (7.5 mi) round
      trip</li><li>Average duration: 5h</li></ul><p>The Seven Hanging Valleys
      Trail is a coastal walk starting at Praia da Marinha and ending at Praia
      do Vale de Centeanes (or vice versa). You can do it either as an
      out-and-back trail which would be 11.4 km (7 miles) in total or you can do
      it only one way (5.7 km/3.5 miles) and then get a taxi/uber back to the
      starting point of the hike.The mostly flat trail offers breathtaking views
      of the Atlantic Ocean and the jagged limestone cliffs rising vertically
      from the turquoise water. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll pass various sandy
      beaches surrounded by impressive rock formations, arches and sinkholes.
      The color of the cliffs ranges from deep orange to vibrant yellow to white
      and creates phenomenal scenery.</p><p>Since the Seven Hanging Valleys is
      one of the most beautiful Algarve hikes, it can get very crowded in the
      summer season. During our visit in December, we were happy to see that
      there were just a handful of other people on the trail</p>

      <h3><strong>Carvoeiro Boardwalk and Algar
      Seco:&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li>Region: Lagoa, South
      Coast</li><li>Distance: 1km</li><li>Average duration: 1h</li></ul><p>You
      can extend the Seven Hanging Valleys hike by walking further to the Algar
      Seco caves and Carvoeiro Boardwalk. They are both amazing places to
      explore and will only add a few extra kilometers to the hike. But you
      could also visit Algar Seco and Carvoeiro Boardwalk by car if you
      don&rsquo;t feel like hiking there.</p>

      <h3><strong>Ponta da Piedade:&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li>Region: Lagos,
      South Coast</li><li>Distance: 6km (4 mi) round trip</li><li>Average
      duration: 2h</li></ul><p>Ponta da Piedade is another spectacular headland
      boasting fantastic rock formations, sea stacks and arches sculpted by wind
      and waves over thousands of years. It is located just outside Lagos, at
      the eastern end of the Rota Vicentina trail.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a true
      marvel of nature with stunning views everywhere you look. Out of all the
      places we visited in the Algarve, Ponta da Piedade might just be the most
      beautiful one and should be a part of every. While here, don&rsquo;t miss
      visiting the picturesque cove at the base of Ponta da Piedade, which can
      be accessed via a set of stairs. As the water in the cove is usually calm
      you can take a boat or a kayak tour to get a closer look at all the arches
      and grottoes. On a windy winter day, however, you can witness an amazing
      show of waves mercilessly pounding the cliffs.</p>

      <p>Trail of Headlands:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Region:
      Lagoa</p></li><li><p><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color:
      var(--color-carbon); font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing:
      0.01rem;">Distance: 6
      km.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Duration:
      2h</p></li></ul><p>The trail of the headlands is a point-to-point or
      return hike in the Algarve. This is an excellent alternative to the Seven
      Hanging Valleys Trail. It&rsquo;s not as well known, and as a result,
      there are far fewer walkers along this route.</p><p>You can start this
      stunning hike at <strong>Praia dos Caneiros</strong> in
      <strong>Ferragudo</strong>, or <strong>Praia do Carvoeiro</strong> in
      <strong>Carvoeiro</strong>. We started at Praia dos Caneiros beach because
      we were staying at Caneiros Luxury House &amp; Suites, which is only a
      5-minute walk to the beach.</p><p>Starting at the parking lot at Praia dos
      Caneiros, the trail leads East. Follow the yellow and red trail markers
      along the headlands. The trail affords you wondrous views of sheer cliffs
      and hidden coves. Unlike the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail, there
      aren&rsquo;t many opportunities to access these coves by foot. So, this
      walk is all about savoring the views.</p><p>Shortly before arriving at
      Carvoeiro, you&rsquo;ll pass <strong>Praia do Paraiso</strong>. This tiny
      beach is accessible by a steep staircase.</p><p>Carvoeiro is a beach town
      that manages to balance its development with its natural beauty. Grab
      lunch here and enjoy the town&rsquo;s idyllic beach, Praia do Carvoeiro.
      For a healthy lunch and delicious smoothies, head to Earth
      Caf&eacute;.</p>

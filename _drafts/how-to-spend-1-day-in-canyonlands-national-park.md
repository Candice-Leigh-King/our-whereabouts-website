      <p>I came with low expectations for Canyonlands and fell in love! It has
      to be one of the most underrated parks we've been to in Utah and I hope
      that you add it to your bucket list. The Colorado River and Green River
      both go through Canyonlands and create the canyons the park takes its name
      from.</p>

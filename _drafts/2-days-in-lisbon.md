      <p>Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, is the perfect city for romantic
      getaways, solo travelers, beach vacations, and foodies. It is a charming
      seaside destination with so much history, but also a combination of
      cosmopolitan.</p><p>If you're planning a trip to Lisbon and only have 2
      days here's an itinerary for you.</p><p>I didn't include Sintra in this
      itinerary because it deserves a post of it's own since you need a full day
      or two!</p>

      <h1>Day 1 -</h1><p>Start your morning at some of the most beautiful
      viewpoints in the city.</p><p><strong>Miradouro da Senhora do
      Monte</strong><br />This viewpoint is located in a churchyard, this
      highest point in the neighborhood offers panoramic views of the city. It's
      one of the most beautiful viewpoints in the city. You can see the entire
      waterfront as well as the bridge.</p><p><strong>Miradouro da
      Gra&ccedil;a</strong><br />Another great viewpoint. This terrace offers
      dramatic, panoramic views of city rooftops &amp; the water
      beyond.</p><p><strong>Saint George&rsquo;s Castle</strong><br />Saint
      George's Castle is a historic castle that dates to at least the 8th
      century BC while the first fortifications built date from the 1st century
      BC. It's a very beautiful place to explore and has a spectacular view of
      the city.</p><p><strong>Miradouro de Santa Luzia</strong><br />We went to
      many viewpoints in Lisbon, &nbsp;and this is our favorite one. It has
      beautiful gardens and balcony view, and gorgeous azulejos (Portuguese and
      Spanish painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework).<br />The best is to come for
      sunset but know that it will be very crowded, that is why we advise you to
      visit in the morning when it's just as beautiful and less
      crowded.​​​​​​</p><p><strong>Miradouro das Portas do Sol</strong><br />Not
      far from Miradouro de Santa Luzia, you'll find this beautiful viewpoint.
      We arrived early in the morning so the bar wasn't open yet and we had the
      place to ourselves.</p><p><strong>Explore Alfama District</strong><br
      />Alfama is the oldest and most characteristic district in Lisbon. It's
      got a very interesting history and walking around here you'll see many of
      its traditional houses.</p><p><strong>Se de
      Lisboa</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eat breakfast at Csntinho da
      Se</p><p>Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio</p><p>Arco da Rua
      Augusta</p><p>Livraria Bertrand</p><p>Santa Justa elevator</p><p>Convent
      of Carmo</p><p>Rossio Square</p><p>Pink Street</p><p>Elevador da
      Bica</p><p>Restaurante Lisboa &eacute; Linda</p>

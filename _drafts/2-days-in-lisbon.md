      <p>Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, is the perfect city for romantic
      getaways, solo travelers, beach vacations, and foodies. It is a charming
      seaside destination with so much history, but also a combination of
      cosmopolitan.</p><p>If you're planning a trip to Lisbon and only have 2
      days here's an itinerary for you.</p><p>I didn't include Sintra in this
      itinerary because it deserves a post of it's own since you need a full day
      or two!</p>

      <h1>Day 1 -</h1><p>Start your morning at some of the most beautiful
      viewpoints in the city.</p><p><strong>Miradouro da Senhora do
      Monte</strong><br />This viewpoint is located in a churchyard, this
      highest point in the neighborhood offers panoramic views of the city. It's
      one of the most beautiful viewpoints in the city. You can see the entire
      waterfront as well as the bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Miradouro da
      Gra&ccedil;a</strong><br />Another great viewpoint. This terrace offers
      dramatic, panoramic views of city rooftops &amp; the water
      beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Saint George&rsquo;s Castle</strong><br
      />Saint George's Castle is a historic castle that dates to at least the
      8th century BC while the first fortifications built date from the 1st
      century BC. It's a very beautiful place to explore and has a spectacular
      view of the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Miradouro de Santa
      Luzia</strong><br />We went to many viewpoints in Lisbon, &nbsp;and this
      is our favorite one. It has beautiful gardens and balcony view, and
      gorgeous azulejos (Portuguese and Spanish painted tin-glazed ceramic
      tilework).<br />The best is to come for sunset but know that it will be
      very crowded, that is why we advise you to visit in the morning when it's
      just as beautiful and less
      crowded.​​​​​​</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Miradouro das Portas do
      Sol</strong><br />Not far from Miradouro de Santa Luzia, you'll find this
      beautiful viewpoint. We arrived early in the morning so the bar wasn't
      open yet and we had the place to ourselves.</p><p><strong>Explore Alfama
      District</strong><br />Alfama is the oldest and most characteristic
      district in Lisbon. It's got a very interesting history and walking around
      here you'll see many of its traditional
      houses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Se de Lisboa</strong><br />The Lisbon
      Cathedral was built in the 1100s, this is one of the oldest monuments in
      Lisbon and is rich in history. If you&rsquo;d like to enter the cathedral
      it costs 5&euro; and provides spectacular views of the
      city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eat brunch at Csntinho da Se</strong><br
      />Right next to Se de Lisboa Cathedral is a nice cafe where we sat and ate
      a good breakfast.We got an omelet with salad, toast with salad, two drinks
      and two pastries and it cost us
      25.9&euro;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pra&ccedil;a do
      Com&eacute;rcio</strong><br />The Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio is a
      large, harbor-facing plaza and is one of the largest in
      Portugal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arco da Rua Augusta</strong><br />The
      Rua Augusta Arch is a stone, triumphal arch-like, historical building on
      the Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio. It was built to commemorate the
      city's reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake.<br />Many don't know, but
      you can climb to the top of Arco da Rua Augusta for 3&euro;, and offers a
      spectacular view of the city, particularly the
      plaza.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Livraria Bertrand</strong><br />Livraria
      Bertrand is the oldest operating bookstore in the world and is worth
      visiting!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Santa Justa Elevator</strong><br
      />The Santa Justa Lift, also called Carmo Lift, is an elevator. It is
      situated at the end of Rua de Santa Justa, and it connects the lower
      streets of the Baixa with the higher Largo do Carmo.<br />When you arrive
      at the Santa Justa elevator you'll find a long line of people waiting to
      go in the elevator.<br />The Santa Justa Lift itself is a tourist trap,
      the ride costs 5&euro;,​​​​​​​ is just a minute long, it's hard to enjoy
      the view and you've got to wait in a long queue.<br />​​​​​​​We recommend
      walking to the top of Santa Justa Lift to enjoy the view of Lisbon without
      wasting time and money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Carmo
      Convent</strong><br />The ruined Carmo Convent is one of Lisbon's most
      beautiful sights. The Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was a former
      Catholic convent that now stands as a reminder of the devastating
      earthquake of 1755 that destroyed most of the city. What makes it so
      captivating is how the arches still stand, but the roof that collapsed was
      never rebuilt and there is no ceiling. Most of the architecture dates back
      to the 1300s.<br />&bull;Inside you'll also find a museum with very
      impressive exhibits.<br />&bull;Check to see if they have the light show
      "Lisbon under stars" during your visit.<br />&bull; Entrance fee:&nbsp;
      5&euro;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rossio Square</strong><br />The Rossio
      is the popular name of King Pedro IV Square. It is located in the
      Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon and has been one of its main squares since
      the Middle Ages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pink Street</strong><br />The
      official name of Pink Street is Rua Nova do Carvalho, located in the
      popular neighborhood of Cais do Sodre. This neighborhood is known for its
      nightlife and during the day there are many coffee shops on the street. If
      you&rsquo;d like to capture an &ldquo;Instagram-worthy&rdquo; photo
      you&rsquo;ll need to arrive early in the morning before the coffee shops
      open. Also, When we visited in May, there was construction being done on
      the street and it was filthy. If you&rsquo;re coming in the afternoon just
      to capture a photo, Don&rsquo;t bother visiting this
      area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Elevador da Bica</strong><br />This
      19th-century tram is one of the most popular in Lisbon.<br />It costs
      &euro;3,80 to ride for 3 minutes. We recommend saving your money and
      walking around the historic streets of Lisbon.<br />It is closed as of May
      2022</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Restaurante Lisboa &eacute;
      Linda</strong></p><p>They have fresh food, good portions, and great
      service.</p>

      <p>Most people drive through Monument Valley and skip straight to the
      Forrest Gump stop, but the Monument Valley, Navajo Tribal Park has a
      beautiful 17-mile loop road and it's worth visiting.</p><p>You can
      self-drive this loop without a 4&times;4. Yes, It&rsquo;s a little bumpy
      and dusty, but we did it with our rental car with no problems. If it
      rains, this road can become impassable so do look at the weather before
      your visit.</p><p>This is the only part of Monument Valley you can visit
      without taking a tour, if you'd like to explore more of Monument Valley
      you'll need to schedule a tour.</p>

      <h2>The Monument Valley Scenic Drive:</h2><p>As you drive you'll have some
      stops along the road to stop and enjoy the view.</p><p>&bull;The wildcat
      Trail: This hike is a 3.2-mile loop that circles around the Mitten Buttes
      and Merrick Butte and it offers incredible views. This is the only
      self-guided trail in Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park.</p><p>&bull;The
      Mittens and Merrick Butte: This stop is a great spot to get up close to
      these monuments.</p><p>&bull;The Three Sisters: Opposite the Mittens,
      you&rsquo;ll find the Three Sisters. These three finger-like stones rise
      out of the red rock.</p><p>&bull;John Ford&rsquo;s point: This is our
      favorite and most iconic spot on the loop. Named after film director John
      Ford, who filmed Stagecoach. For 5$ you can even take an iconic shot on a
      horse.</p><p>&bull;Totem pole: It is an incredible and remarkable rock
      feature. It is the tallest spire in the world at a prominence of 381
      feet.</p><p>&bull;Artist&rsquo;s point: Another popular scenic point.</p>

      <h2>Forrest Gump Point:</h2><p>Have you even been to Monument Valley if
      you haven't visited this spot? It's best to visit this spot in the morning
      or early afternoon because, in the late afternoon and early evening,
      you'll be facing the sun. The speed limit on this road is low, but it's
      still important to watch for cars because this road gets busy, especially
      in the afternoon.</p>

      <h2><strong>Mexican Hat:</strong></h2><p>The Mexican Hat is a weird and
      wonderful natural formation located outside of the formal park.</p>

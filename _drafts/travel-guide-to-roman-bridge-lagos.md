      <p>This is one of Lagos&rsquo;s most photographed beaches due to the
      famous Roman Bridge which linked the mainland with Pinhao
      Fortress.</p><p>▪︎𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞:</p><p>It's
      called the Student beach because it&rsquo;s a small beach that can fit a
      class of students.</p><p>▪︎𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞:</p><p>If you
      enter Roman bridge Lagos into Waze/google maps you won't reach the right
      place. It'll take you to the top of the bridge where the staircase to the
      beach is closed.</p><p>To get to the beach you need to go to Praia dos
      Estudantes, walk down the steps, and on your right, there is a tunnel in
      the rock that will lead you to the Roman
      Bridge.</p><p>▪︎𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠:</p><p>&bull; Paid Parking: This is the
      closest parking to the beach but also the smallest. It costs 1.2 Euro for
      2 hours</p><p>Located near Mar Restaurant &amp; Bar (37.096938,
      -8.668508)</p><p>&bull;Free parking: R. Bombeiros Volunt&aacute;rios de
      Lagos (37.096294, -8.670520) or</p><p>R. Jos&eacute; Formosinho
      (37.095322, -8.669927).</p><p>▪︎𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭:</p><p>This beach
      is located in the center of Lagos which means it'll get crowded very
      quickly. Try to arrive at sunrise because they are
      spectacular.</p><p>▪︎𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬:</p><p>You can rent a kayak from
      Praia da Batata and see the bridge from the water. During high tide, you
      can even go underneath the bridge by kayak.</p><p>▪︎𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨
      𝐞𝐚𝐭:</p><p>Mar Restaurant &amp; Bar is the closest as has an amazing
      view.</p><p>Old Town Lagos is a 10-minute walk and there are plenty of
      options to eat there.</p>

      <p>Did you know that the Valley of Fire is Nevada’s oldest and largest
      state park?</p><p>It's filled with red rock formations made from Aztec
      sandstone and contains ancient, petrified trees and petroglyphs dating
      back more than 2,000 years. The stunning red sandstone rock formations
      illuminate the valley, especially at sunset, making it look appear as
      though it’s on fire.</p><p>Here's how to spend 1 day in Valley of
      Fire:</p>

      <h2>Elephant Rock:</h2><p>Start your day at Elephant Rock:
      𝐄𝐥𝐞𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐑𝐨𝐜𝐤: 0.3 miles (0.4km) | 16min</p><p>The rock
      formation is named so because it resembles an elephant with its trunk and
      ear.</p><p>🏜️𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡: The arch is made of sandstone and
      was formed over thousands of years by erosion.</p><p>🪨𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝
      𝐑𝐨𝐜𝐤: 0.25 miles (0.4km) | 15min</p><p>This short hike begins next to
      the visitor center for VoF State Park. It's a cool formation of red
      sandstone that seems to be standing quite
      precariously.</p><p>🌈𝐑𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐨𝐰 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚: 1.4 miles (2.4km) |
      45min</p><p>This hike takes you through slot canyons &amp; leads you to a
      scenic viewpoint that offers panoramic views of the park's colorful
      sandstone formations.</p><p>💖𝐏𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐨𝐧: 0.8 miles |
      30min</p><p>This trail offers beautiful pink colors on the rock
      formations. It’s also a quicker route to Fire Wave!</p><p>🔥𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐞
      𝐖𝐚𝐯𝐞: 1.5 miles (2.4km) | 2 hours</p><p>The Fire Wave is a stunning,
      natural sandstone formation that is characterized by its wave-like,
      swirling patterns, and pink, orange, and red colors.</p><p>🤍𝐓𝐡𝐞
      𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬: 1.1 miles (1.8km) | 1 hour</p><p>This trail offers
      stunning landscapes that reinvent themselves around every
      turn.</p><p>🐭𝐌𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐇𝐢𝐤𝐞:(shown in photo 📸)</p><p>If
      you want to hop out and get a picture, the best spot is right before the
      Rainbow Vista trailhead at a small pullout along the road (Coordinates:
      36.448830, -114.515656) and hike to 'Mouse's tank Road Photo location'.
      The best time to take photos is right at sunrise or
      sunset.</p><p>🐝𝐁𝐞𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬:</p><p>The Beehives are sandstone
      formations that demonstrate unique designs that can be created by
      nature.</p>

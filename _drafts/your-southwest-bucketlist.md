        If you would like that awesome scroll feature that happens when someone
        clicks on a link in the navigation, then you'll need to add a page id.
        The page id can be added in the below box labeled "link". Your id is a
        short word describing the section it is leading to. For example- about.
        If you don't want this section to link from the navigation, you can
        simply leave it out.

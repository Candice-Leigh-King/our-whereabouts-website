      <strong>find </strong>the best viewpoints and cool photo locations, this
      post is for you. Each viewpoint has a little bit of a different angle but
      they&rsquo;re all breathtaking. Keep in mind they&rsquo;re not guarded so

      <h3><strong>Sunset rock:</strong></h3><p>This was our favorite spot to
      watch the sunset and I guess others agree since this spot is also known as
      Sunset rock.</p><p>It isn't difficult to get to but do know that the rock
      I'm standing on in this photo isn't connected to the viewpoint and you'll
      need to jump a little to reach it.</p><p>There are 3 parking spots (max 5
      cars can fit in here) so arrive early.</p><p>Coordinates: 39.721378,
      21.634522</p>

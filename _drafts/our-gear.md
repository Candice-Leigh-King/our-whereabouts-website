      <h2><strong>Camera:</strong></h2><p>Canon M50 Mark II.&nbsp;</p><p>The M50
      is Canon's very first Mirrorless camera and it is a great start for those
      wanting to get quality photos on a budget. We love it also because it is
      lightweight and perfect for traveling.</p>

      -</p><p>This is the lens that comes with the Camera. It is simple and
      great for portrait photos.</p><p>Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS
      STM&nbsp; -</p><p>This is our telephoto and it is a game-changer. It takes
      your photos to a whole new level.<br />​​​​​</p><p>San Disk SD Card - 2TB
      -</p><p>You're going to want to buy this if you're shooting RAW
      images.</p><p>Canon LP-E12 Batteries -</p><p>We have 4 of these because we
      found that the batteries can last somewhere between 1-4hours. If you're
      out for a full day and love to take photos as much as we do, You're going
      to want at least 3 batteries.</p>

      This has been a really great tripod for beginners. It is affordable,
      lightweights and comes with a remote for your phone.


      We just invested in a new tripod - Peak Design Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod
      and we will give our review on it later on.

        If you would like that awesome scroll feature that happens when someone
        clicks on a link in the navigation, then you'll need to add a page id.
        The page id can be added in the below box labeled "link". Your id is a
        short word describing the section it is leading to. For example- about.
        If you don't want this section to link from the navigation, you can
        simply leave it out.

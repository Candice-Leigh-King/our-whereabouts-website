      <h2>Train:&nbsp;</h2><p>The train is a good way to get around the Algarve
      but not every town has a train station and the train stations aren't
      necessarily in the center of the town.<br />You can order tickets<a
      href="https://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en"> from here!</a></p><p>The main
      towns that have a train are: Lagos, Portim&atilde;o, and
      Faro</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bus:&nbsp;</h2><p>There are a few buses that
      connect you to most of the towns. The main bus company in the Algarve is
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vamusalgarve.pt/">Vamus
      Algarve</a> but most buses run only in the summer so make sure to check
      before you go</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Uber/Taxi:&nbsp;</h2><p>Uber is common
      in coastal towns like Albufeira, and if you&rsquo;re somewhere more remote
      you might have to wait longer.</p><h2>Car:&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to
      get around is in the Algarve. They say that driving in Portugal isn't
      advised, but actually, the Algarve is one of the easiest places to drive
      in Portugal. It's very convenient to rent a car here because you are
      flexible, it's the fastest way to get around, you are able to cover more
      places, parking is free and toll roads are cheap.</p>

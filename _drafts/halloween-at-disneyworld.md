  title: Halloween at Disneyworld
  description: >
    One of the best times to visit Disneyworld is during the holidays. The whole
    park changes. There are decorations, different food, and characters you
    won't see on a typical day. It is more magical than always.

    Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party is a ticketed event on select nights
    between August and October at Magic Kingdom. The party takes over the entire
    park after it is closed to non-ticketed guests. The party is from 7 PM to
    12:30 AM, but what not everybody knows is that you can arrive at 4 PM.

      <h2>Tickets:</h2><p><strong>Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween
      Party:&nbsp;</strong> 158$ (563 NIS) for both of
      us.</p><h2>Costumes:</h2><p>Adults are not allowed to come in Costumes to
      Disneyworld, except for on Halloween! People get creative with their
      costumes, and it's also part of the experience.</p><h2>Trick or
      Treating:&nbsp;</h2><p>When you arrive at the park, you get a wristband
      and a bag that you could use to trick or treat. Around the park, some
      spots let you go and trick. If you're going to the park to mainly trick or
      treat, I would bring a bigger bag than the little one they give out at the
      entrance.</p>

      <h2>Memory Maker:&nbsp;</h2><p>If you have a memory maker during this
      event, the photos are edited excellently in the Halloween theme. It's
      pretty cool.</p><h2>Special Foods and Desserts:&nbsp;</h2><p>Disney has
      themed food and snacks it's so great. The candy corn ice cream is
      delicious!</p><h2>Special Characters:&nbsp;</h2><p>They have special
      Characters that come out on Halloween that don't come out any other day at
      the park, such as Jack Skellington &amp; Sally and Elvis stitch. Mickey
      Minnie and the gang have different costumes every year.</p><h2>Hocus Pocus
      Villain Spelltacular:&nbsp;</h2><p>This show is excellent. Make sure to go
      to the last showing since most kids are too tired to stay up by then, and
      it's got fewer people. It is shown at 7:40 PM, 8:35 PM, 10:45 PM, and 12
      AM. The 7:40 showing is the fullest.</p><h2>Happy Hallowishes
      Fireworks:&nbsp;</h2><p>The most impressive fireworks! It's so great! They
      have this only once that night at 10:15 PM; people usually leave right
      after this show.</p><h2>Mickey's "Boo-To-You" Halloween
      Parade:&nbsp;</h2><p>This parade features unique Halloween-themed floats
      and appearances from rarely-seen characters like the Gravediggers and
      Hitchhiking ghosts. The parade occurs twice, at 9:15 PM and 11:15 PM. I
      recommend going to 11:15 because you can catch a seat for it right after
      the fireworks. Get a seat on the sidewalk near Casey's Corner.</p>

      <p><strong>We love Disneyworld! Next time we go, we will stay in a Disney
      hotel and go to the other parks. I highly recommend going to the Halloween
      party.</strong></p>

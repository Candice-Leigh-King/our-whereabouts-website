      <h2><strong>7. GET TRAVEL INSURANCE:</strong></h2><p>Don't ever fly
      without travel insurance. It's only a couple of Dollars a day and it can
      save you thousands of Dollars in case of a medical emergency.</p><p>It is
      important to understand that the medical insurance you have in your
      country doesn't apply to your travels therefore it is important to get
      travel insurance.</p><p>It is really important to focus on the medical
      issue and our baggage and less on other things that are usually insurance
      attempts to add in order to make money off you.</p><p><strong>Of course
      today one has to make sure that everything related to Corona is covered in
      terms of insurance.</strong></p>

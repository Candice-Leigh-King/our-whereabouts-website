      <h2>1. Scope out the Griffith Observatory</h2><p>One of our favorite spots
      in Los Angeles. The view is breathtaking and you can see the Hollywood
      Sign from here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Tour a working studio</h2><p>There
      are few things as exciting as seeing Hollywood magic at work. like
      Universal Studios, Warner Bros, and Paramount Pictures
      Studios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Hollywood Bowl</h2><p>See if there are any
      concerts during your trip. There's no better way to enjoy live music
      outdoors with a fantastic view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Have fun at Santa
      Monica Pier</h2><p>There are many great spots to take pictures and spend
      time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Stroll the Hollywood Walk of

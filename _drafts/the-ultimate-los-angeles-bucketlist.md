      <h2><strong>1. PICK A DESTINATION:</strong></h2><p>You're probably
      thinking 'this is the easy part, I will go where I want to' but it isn't
      always the case. There are are a few things to take into consideration
      when choosing a destination.</p><ul><li><strong>Budget:</strong> This is
      the first thing you should consider when planning a trip. No matter your
      financial situation you should have an idea of how much you can spend on
      your trip before you start planning. Take into consideration that not
      always a destination that has cheap flight means it is the cheapest option
      because the flight itself could be somewhere between 5%-50% of your
      budget, depending on many things. <strong>How do you find out if the
      destination you want to go to in on your budget?</strong><strong>
      </strong>Ask google! Usually we type the<em> destination + amount of days
      + daily cost</em> and google gives us an estimated number. If you know
      someone who has been to the destination I would ask them too. You could
      also know based on the currency used in that destination. For example,
      countries that use Euro are usually more
      expensive.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> whether or not you're
      traveling solo, with a spouse or with friends, you should always check to
      see if the country you desire to visit is safe.</li><li><strong>Covid-19:
      </strong>Covid has been a major part of our life since 2020 and has
      affected the way we travel drastically. It is very important to check the
      destination you are looking at and see what their requirements are. Some
      countries ask for PCR test 24/72 hours before flight, some demand
      isolation for a time period and some ask for none of
      these.</li><li><strong>Weather: </strong>check to see what the weather is
      like during the dates you would like to visit. You could do so by checking
      Accuweather. It shows what it was like last year and then estimate what
      the weather would be like during the dates you want to.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>2. BOOK YOUR FLIGHT:</strong></h2><p>You've decided on a
      destination, mazal tov! Let's book a flight! Here are some of our tips on
      how to book the cheapest flights:</p><ul><li><strong>Incognito:
      </strong>Use your browser in Incognito mode in order to get the best
      prices. When you're searching for flights, the more you search for it, the
      more the fare price increase. Why is that? It is due to the cookies in
      your browser. While using incognito the website isn't able to track your
      search and therefore the prices don't increase.</li><li><strong>Where to
      book:</strong> We use<a href="http://skyscanner.com/"> Skyscanner.com</a>
      (this is our first option) use Skyscanner to find flights and once we find
      a flight that fits us we then check it on the site directly with the
      flight company or on Edreams and Kiwi.</li><li><strong>Be
      flexible:</strong> It's easier said than done, especially if you've got a
      9-5 job during the week, but avoiding holidays and weekends are key for
      finding a cheap flight. Our favorite thing about Skyscanner is the option
      to search for flights 'Anywhere' and 'cheapest month'. You can find really
      great deals when doing so.</li><li><strong>Book in advance:</strong> Some
      destinations will be cheaper the earlier you book the flight since most
      airlines will increase their fare prices as your departure date
      approaches.</li><li><strong>Book a flight with a lay-over:</strong> Direct
      flights always cost more. There are those who prefer direct flights but
      there are a few great reasons why you should consider a layover. In
      addition to it being cheaper, if you're traveling far, this gives you some
      time to get some fresh air and stretch your legs. <strong>Long
      layovers:</strong> long layovers could be a great way to explore another
      destination on the way to your final destination. Many airports have
      lockers or hotels where you can rest/leave your luggage in and then you
      can go and explore the city you're in.</li><li><strong>Fly with budget
      airlines:</strong> Budget airline (low cost) are a great way to fly for
      cheaper.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><blockquote><h3><strong>Yay, you booked a
      flight! How exciting! What now?</strong></h3></blockquote>

      <h2><strong>3. RESEARCH:</strong></h2><p>First thing you're going to want
      to do is research about the destination you're going to. There are a few
      places to search for information; Pinterest &amp; travel blogs, Instagram,
      Facebook, TripAdvisor, and YouTube. <strong>My favorites are travel blogs
      and Instagram.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pinterest &amp; Travel blogs:
      </strong>Pinterest is a great way to find the best blogs. All you need to
      do is use key words that describe what you're looking for and you get the
      best results. For example: Hidden gems in Vienna, where to eat in Vienna,
      day trips from Vienna.</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Instagram is a
      real help while planning trips. You could search for the destination
      through hashtags or location and find posts from travelers who have been
      to your destination. Instagram is a great way to find hidden
      gems.</li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Did you know that almost every
      city has a Facebook group for travelers? By joining these groups you not
      only have access to information but you are also able to ask questions and
      get answers from fellow travelers who are in the
      group.</li><li><strong>TripAdvisor:</strong> Another great tool to look
      for recommendations from fellow
      travelers.</li><li><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube is a different world
      because you can find really great travel guides here that include visuals
      footage of the destination you're looking to visit. Sometimes it can
      really help to see the place you are going to before you go.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>4. DECIDE WHAT YOU MUST-SEE:</strong></h2><p>After you've done
      your research decide what is important to you to see in the destination
      and what you are willing to give up on. Remember! Not everything that
      suits one person means it's what suits you. It is important that you do
      what you think will interest you.</p>

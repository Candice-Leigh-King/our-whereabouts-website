      We are Elizabeth and Dan, adventure travel couple behind Our Whereabouts!
      We began dating in 2016 and quickly discovered that we both have a passion
      for travel adventure when we booked a month-long trip to Thailand after
      only 7 months of dating. Since then we have absolutely fallen in love with
      exploring the world, particularly off the beaten paths. We are based in
      Israel, work hard, save up, and always have a trip booked on the horizon.
      When we get back from our trips we are always eager to share our stories,
      helpful tips, and beautiful photos. Why our whereabouts? Because our
      family and friends are constantly asking us for our whereabouts since we
      never seem to be in the country. Our mission is to document and share
      authentic outdoor adventure experiences across the globe, share engaging
      stories with professional photos and provide beneficial, informative tips,
      itineraries, travel guides, to-do lists, where to stay, and more.

      Every step leads us to new opportunities and colors our experiences with
      beautiful photos.

      Elizabeth is half American half Colombian born in LA but grew up in
      Israel. She has always remembered herself with a smile on her face, a
      camera in her left hand, and tons of photos in her right, reminiscing the
      adventures she’s had. In late 2021, she left my job in the medical field
      to pursue the dream of becoming full-time travel bloggers. "They say that
      if you find a job that you enjoy, then you’ll never work a day in your
      life".

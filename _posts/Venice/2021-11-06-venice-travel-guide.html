    Dan and I flew to Venice in September 2021 with low expectations and quickly
    fell in love with this city. We finally understand why 5 MILLION people
    visit this beautiful city each year.

    We had very little time to get ready for this spontaneous trip but here's
    what we've learned from our visit.

      <h2><strong>BEST TIME TO VISIT:</strong></h2><ul><li><p>September until
      Mid-October.</p></li><li><p>Early spring.</p></li><li><p>During Venice
      Carnival but I would go during the week, not on weekends.<br /><br
      />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><strong>WHEN TO
      AVOID:</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Mid-October -January because of Acqua Alta
      floods. Do know that <strong>November</strong> is prime time for the Acqua
      Alta floods. Acqua Alta floods - is the phenomenon by which <strong>Venice
      is flooded temporarily when the sea tide rises over 90
      cm!</strong></p></li><li><p>June &amp; July.<br /><br
      />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><strong>GETTING
      AROUND:</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Walking:</strong> The most common
      way of getting around is by walking. There are a lot of small busy
      alleyways and staircases so walking with luggage can be a bit of a hassle
      when making your way to your hotel. If you&rsquo;re just looking to
      explore the shops or get food, walking to your destination will be the
      easiest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water Taxi:</strong> If you&rsquo;re
      looking to go somewhere a bit further or have heavy bags that you
      don&rsquo;t want to carry, you can take a water taxi. If you take a train
      into Venice, you can walk out of the train station and the first bridge
      that you see is the main bridge. Right underneath there are water
      taxis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water Buses:</strong> Water buses, aka
      Vaporetto, are another option for getting around. You can buy a bus pass
      that will allow you to ride for your full
      trip.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gondolas:</strong> Lastly, there are the
      gondolas. It costs close to 80 Euros (you can lower them to 60 Euros) for
      30 minutes so it&rsquo;s not really worth it just for getting from place
      to place.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><strong>TAKING A GONDOLA RIDE
      ISN'T ESSENTIAL</strong></h2><p>Most people who come to Venice want to
      experience a Gondola ride. Before our trip, we asked our Instagram
      followers if they recommend doing the gondola ride since it wasn't on our
      bucketlist. We were surprised when most of them advised us NOT to take the
      Gondola ride.</p><p>It costs <strong>80 Euro</strong>, but you can lower
      it to 60 Euro <strong>for a</strong> <strong>30-minute</strong>
      ride.</p><p>At night the price is 100 Euro for 30
      minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>GET A VAPORETTO TOURIST
      PASS</strong></h2><p>If you get lost (which happens to everyone in Venice)
      or you&rsquo;re simply too tired of walking around you can hop on and off
      a Vaporetto. A Vaporetto is Venice's version of a bus.</p><p>Prices:
      <strong>A single ride is 7.5 Euro. </strong>I would consider getting one
      of the Vaporetto passes as we did. There are a few options depending on
      how long your stay is. 20 Euro for 24 hours per person. 30 Euro for 48
      hours per person. 40 Euro for 72 hours per person. and 60 Euro for 7 days
      per person.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>SOUVENIR
      STALLS</strong></h2><p>Riva degli Schiavoni is filled with souvenir
      stalls. It is a huge tourist trap and I recommend that you go deeper into
      Venice and buy authentic souvenirs. For example, you can buy glass
      directly from Murano or lace in Burano. I always bring home from
      Italy.</p><p>If you do choose to get the souvenirs from the stalls, I
      would get all of them from one spot and bargain for a good price.</p>

      <h2><strong>WATER FOUNTAINS</strong></h2><p>While visiting Rome we
      discovered from the locals that there are water fountains all around that
      you can drink from. In Venice, they have these same fountains with fresh
      cold water. Bring a water bottle and fill up your bottle when need be. It
      saves money since Venice is expensive and it reduces plastic
      waste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DON'T FEED PIGEONS</strong></h2><p>It's
      kind of the same advice I gave with the monkeys in Asia. Once you give
      them little a little bit of your food, more will come and they won't leave
      you alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU
      SIT</strong></h2><p>Since the best way of getting around is walking,
      you're going to want to sit at some point, but you'll find there the
      options are very slim. There aren't many benches. The local council has a
      number of rules for visitors in order to maintain its beauty, reduce
      litter, and preserve a modicum of peace/sanity for residents and if
      broken, you could get a 200 Euro fine therefore you can not sit just
      anywhere you want, even if it's a
      step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BATHROOMS</strong></h2><p>If you thought
      that finding somewhere to sit was hard, bathrooms are even harder. Public
      toilets are few and far between in Venice, they have limited opening hours
      and cost 1.5 Euro to enter. You'll see signs around the city that points
      towards the bathrooms but you'll find yourself walking for quite a while
      without finding them in the end since they are tucked away.</p><p>What we
      found to be the best solution is to go to a cafe, order an espresso or a
      soft drink, use their bathroom, finish your drink, and then leave. This is
      acceptable just try not to make it too
      obvious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BEAT THE CROWDS</strong></h2><p>WAKE
      UP EARLY! This is the best advice we could give you.</p><p>Venice is one
      of the most beautiful cities we've been to, but in the afternoon it
      quickly losses from its beauty with the number of people walking around
      and trying to capture photos in the popular spots in the city.</p><p>6 AM
      is a great hour to start your day before everyone arrives. You'll start
      feeling the crowds already at 11 AM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>SIM
      CARDS:</strong></h2><p>We found it pretty hard to find a sim card in
      Venice. Try to come with a SIM card already on you or before you arrive in
      Venice. The only spot we ended up finding was in Vodafone near Rialto
      Bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>SITTING FEES IN
      RESTAURANTS:</strong></h2><p>Do take into consideration that in
      restaurants they charge sitting fee which is usually 2 Euro per
      person.</p>

      <h3><strong>Important:</strong><br />&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>In order to
      reduce visitors Venice has decided that Beginning of summer 2022, visitors
      will have to make a reservation in advance and pay a fee in order to visit
      Venice. If you're planning a trip to Venice in 2022 I would be on the
      lookout for this!</strong></p>

    Located 50 minutes away from Venice are two islands you shouldn't miss
    during your visit. It's a charming place, with a calmer pace than Venice
    where you are able to get away from the crowds. It is a group of islands
    within the Venice district that are made up of several small islands
    connected together by a series of canals and bridges, similar to Venice.

      <h5><strong>How to get there:</strong></h5><p>There are a few options: The
      first is with a public Vaporetto Line 12 from Fondamete Nove. Make sure
      that you are waiting at the right Ferry station! It costs 7.5 Euro per
      person for a one-way journey, therefore, I would get a 24-hour transport
      ticket for 20 Euros.</p><p>The second option is organized
      tours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>How long to stay
      here:</strong></h5><p>You could do this as a half-day trip or a full-day
      trip. Since we only had 2 full days in Venice we spent half a day in
      Murano and Burano together but felt like it was enough time to enjoy and
      explore this area. There is also an option of staying in Murano, there are
      guest houses there and its a great way to discover the island while there
      aren't any tourists, but I would only recommend this if you have a few
      days in Venice and have seen everything it has to
      offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>Best Times to
      Visit:</strong></h5><p>Try to arrive before 10 AM to beat the
      crowds.</p><p>Early Spring or September -
      mid-October.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>When to
      Avoid:</strong></h5><ul><li>June &amp; July</li><li>November because of
      Aqua Alta (it can flood any time between mid-October to January, but Nov
      is the prime time)</li></ul>

      <h2>MURANO:</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the way to Burano, The Vaporetto stops
      at this island. Don't skip it, it is just as wonderful! Murano is known
      for its <strong>glass blowing</strong> that has been produced since the
      13th century.</p><p>Furthermore, Murano is famous for its glass blowing
      and you can see live demonstrations at the various factories that are
      established here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is there to do on the
      island?</h2><p><strong>Basilica di Santa Maria:</strong></p><p>Located in
      the center of Murano island is this lovely old church, rebuilt in the 12th
      century and dedicated to C4th St Donatus, whose remains are located behind
      the altar.</p><p>The interior is just as beautiful as the exterior but the
      caretaker doesn't allow for photos to be taken, please respect his
      wishes.</p><p>One thing that amazed me was the fact that on an island that
      is sinking, they have been able to preserve and maintain the church for
      all these
      centuries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bell Tower
      in Campo Santo Stefano:</strong></p><p>The tower is located in a beautiful
      square that has lots of shops, cafes, restaurants and ice cream parlors.
      It used to have a blue comet glass artwork, but it wasn't there when we
      visited in September 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Former
      Church Santa Chiara Murano:</strong> This place gives a glass-blowing
      demonstration. very interesting and entertaining. You can watch it for
      free from the street and deal with the crowds of people who want to see it
      too or take a tour inside that costs 10 Euros. I read a few disappointing
      reviews about it, therefore we decided to skip it due to lack of time, but
      if this is your first time seeing glassblowing I would take the
      tour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to eat?</h2><p><strong>Lunch -</strong> We
      found this cute restaurant garden called <strong>Osteria Al Duomo
      </strong>located right across from Basilica di Santa Maria. We
      ordered<strong> </strong>bolognese pasta and White pesto pizza. It was
      excellent. They charge 2 Euro to sit, so worth it to sit in the shade
      after walking for so long in the heat.</p><p><strong>Ice Cream
      -</strong><strong> </strong>Don't miss the ice cream at <strong>Murano
      Artisan ice cream. </strong>We got the pistachio and sorbet and it was
      absolutely incredible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>BURANO:</h2><p>Burano is a small fishing island and is known for its
      <strong>lace</strong>. The women of Burano have been making lace since the
      1400s and exporting them around the world.</p><p>Protected by law,
      homeowners in Burano supposedly have to apply for permission to repaint
      their houses, with only a selected range of colors permitted.</p><p>There
      are two theories for the houses of Burano one is that the rainbow palette
      lining the shores of this small island made it easier for fishermen to
      find their way home and the second is that it assisted them in
      distinguishing their own house from that of their
      neighbors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is there to do on the
      island?</h2><p><strong>Museo de Murletto - the local lace
      museum:</strong></p><p>I recommend it if you&rsquo;d like to learn about
      the history of Burano lace. The museum is small and you can walk through
      it in 15 minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Buy
      Lace:</strong></p><p>There are tourist shops selling lace dresses and
      accessories, however, most of this lace is no longer hand-made. There are
      only a few traditional lace makers left on the island and you&rsquo;ll
      know if the lace is real or not by the
      price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Walk around and enjoy the beautiful
      colorful houses:</strong></p><p>There are about two main areas on this
      small island but we recommend roaming around and getting lost, and finding
      beautiful hidden
      gems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>San
      Martino Church:</strong></p><p>The "learning bell tower" of San Martino
      Church, located in the main square. This bell tower is slowly sinking in
      the wet ground, and you can see it from many parts of the island.</p>

  title: 2 day Itinerary Venice
  description: >
    We had 2 full days in Venice (3 nights), we decided to make the most out of
    those 2 days and explore Venice as much as possible. We could have stayed a
    day longer but if you're limited with time don't worry, 2 days is a good
    amount of time to explore this magical city.

    If you're feeling adventurous like us here is our itinerary.

      <h1><strong>Day 1 -</strong></h1><h2>St. Mark's Square</h2><p>We woke up
      early to catch the sunrise at St. Mark's Square. It is one of the most
      popular spots in the city therefore arrive early to beat the crowds. There
      is something extremely romantic and beautiful about watching the sunrise
      here.</p><h2>Bridge Of Sighs</h2><p>Head on over to the Bridge of Sighs
      which is located right around the corner from St. Mark's Square.<br
      />There are 4 different angles where you can capture a photo with this
      bridge:<br /><strong>Option 1:</strong> Ponte della Paglia: It's a bridge
      right next to St. Mark's square and just behind the Doge's Palace.<br
      /><strong>Option 2:</strong> Below Ponte della Pagila (in photo): When
      facing the Bridge of Sighs walk to your right off the bridge and make a
      left turn to an alley for this cool spot in this photo.<br
      /><strong>Option 3:</strong> The bridge near Trattoria Canonica&rlm;
      restaurant.<br /><strong>Option 4:</strong> Gondola ride. This is a great
      option, but an expensive one. (Most expensive option..)</p><h2>Teatro La
      Fenice:</h2><p>From San Marco neighborhood we headed towards Teatro La
      Fenice, Venice's opera house. It is the most famous landmarks in the
      history of Italian theater it was repeatedly destroyed and risen from its
      ashes. I have to say that from the outside it isn't as impressive but I
      would love to go back to Venice and watch the opera here.</p><h2>Hotel San
      Moise:</h2><p>We wanted to capture a photo that is Instagram famous so we
      entered 'Hotel San Moise' into our google maps and found this lovely spot
      to take a photo with the Calle Dario la Chiesa bridge in the
      background.</p><h2>Ponte Maria Callas</h2><p>From there we headed towards
      another beautiful bridge you shouldn't miss Ponte Maria
      Callas.</p><h2>Contarini Del Bovolo</h2><p>Not far is Palazzo Contarini
      del Bovolo. It is a small palazzo in Venice, Italy, best known for its
      external multi-arch spiral staircase with a spectacular view of the city.
      Don't forget to buy tickets ahead of time!<br /><strong>Entrance
      Fee:</strong> 7 Euro.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day,
      10:00 AM to 18:00 PM.</p><h2>Venchi (Ice cream)</h2><p>At this point we
      were a little hungry so we got Ice cream at Venchi at Calle dei Fabbri.
      It's one of our favorite ice creams in Italy.</p><h2>Ponte
      Balbi&nbsp;</h2><p>This bridge is close by don't miss this
      one.</p><h2>Ponte di Rialto</h2><p>You'll walk another 450m and reach the
      magnificent Ponte di Rialto. There are many ways to admire this bridge.<br
      />Coordination's for this spot: 45.4384198,
      12.3359621</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>T Fondaco Rooftop
      Terrance</strong></h2><p>Next to the Rialto bridge there is a cool
      shopping mall, inside this mall, there is a secret viewpoint called T
      Fondaco Rooftop Terrance. There is no entrance fee but you must reserve
      your 15-minute time slot online in advance!<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Daily, 10:30 AM to 6:30 PM.</p><h2>Trattproa Da Gigi
      Restuarant</h2><p>At this point we got hungry and decided to sit down and
      eat. We found a beautiful garden restaurant <strong>Trattoria Da
      Gigi</strong> which wasn't too far from our next destination
      <strong>Libreria Acqua Alta.</strong></p><h2><strong>Libreria Auqa
      Alta</strong></h2><p>he most unique bookstore you'll ever visit. The magic
      starts the moment you enter. You'll find hidden gems all around, friendly
      cats everywhere, a gondola in the middle of the store and at the end of it
      is a photo op.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Daily, 9 AM &ndash; 7:45 PM.</p><p>We
      were very tired since we woke up very early so we decided to end the day
      pretty early.</p>

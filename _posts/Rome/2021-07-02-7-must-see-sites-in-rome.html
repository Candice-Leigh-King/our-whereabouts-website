    There's a reason why Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world.
    Renowned as the birthplace of the mouth-watering Gelato and the home to the

      <h2><strong>1. THE PANTHEON:</strong></h2><p>The Pantheon (Latin:
      Pantheum) in Rome is a former Roman temple that was completed in 125 CE.
      It is the only ancient Roman building that has remained intact throughout
      the centuries. Built on the site of an earlier temple, Marcus Agrippa was
      commissioned during the reign of Augustus. It was then rebuilt by the
      emperor Hadrian.</p><p>Here are a few interesting facts about the
      Pantheon:<br />&bull;It is about 2,000 years old.<br />&bull;The building
      was built with a huge 45 meters dome - an amazing architectural
      achievement for the days of ancient Rome. The dome's weight is 4,535
      tonnes!<br />&bull;It was the first temple built for the "common people,"
      which was <strong>uncommon</strong>. Temples in ancient times were for
      priests.<br />&bull;The name "Pantheon" is from the Ancient Greek meaning
      "all the gods"<br />&bull;The huge Pantheon dome has been the largest in
      the world for 1300 years and, to this day is the largest dome in the
      world.<br />&bull;An amazing effect can be seen each year on <strong>April
      21 </strong>when the sun's rays enter the oculus and create a disk of
      light at the entrance of the doorway. Rome's birthday is celebrated on
      April 21, and it is believed that on that day, Emperor Hadrian wanted to
      stand at the temple entrance, with his body bathed in golden sunlight, as
      if the gods were calling him from above to join
      them.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Every day, 9:00 am to 7:00 pm (last entry 6:30 pm).</p>

      <h2><strong>2. THE COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUM &amp; PALATINE
      HILL:</strong></h2><p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center
      of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the
      largest ancient amphitheater ever built and is still the largest standing
      amphitheater in the world today, despite its age. It is one of the World's
      Wonders and DEFINITELY worth visiting once in a lifetime. As you spend
      time in the Colosseum, you feel like you've goen back in time. The
      decision to purchase tickets for the "full tour" that included not only
      the arena floor (regular entrance fee) but also a Panoramic view and
      underground view with a small group including a great tour guide, was a
      wise choice and money well spent. The extra cost allowed us backstage,
      where the exotic animals and gladiators were brought to the arena.<br
      />The Arena - Regular entrance gives you access to the main arena, one of
      the important parts of the Colosseum, where games, battles, and shows take
      place.<br />The underground - Venture into the arena and the underground
      tunnels where gladiators and wild animals awaited to fight.<br />Panoramic
      Terrence - you can admire the Colosseum from its most impressive point of
      view and get amazing photos!</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong><br
      />&bull; Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 18 EURO per adult.<br
      />&bull; Skip-the-Line Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 30 EURO
      per adult.<br />&bull; Colosseum Underground, Arena, Panoramic Terrence,
      Roman Forum &amp; Hill Tour - 60 EURO per adult. (What we took). This tour
      is 2-3 hours. <em>It's possible to access the Colosseum only at the time
      chosen during the booking phase, and it's suggested to show up at the
      entrance 15 minutes before the chosen time. The entrance to the Colosseum
      is located at the "Sperone Valadier", near the Arch of
      Constantine.</em><br /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Every day. Last
      admission one hour before closing.<br />&bull;January 2nd-February 28th,
      2022: From 9:30 am to 4:30 pm.<br />&bull;March 1st-26th, 2022: From 9:30

      <h2><strong>4. CASTEL SANT'ANGELO:</strong></h2><p>Legend has it that the
      name of the castle was given after the Archangel Michael appeared at the
      top of the castle, sheathing his sword and, with that, ending the plague
      of 590 which tormented Rome. An imposing statue of an angel can be seen on
      top of the castle. People tend to skip going inside, but I highly
      recommend not it&rsquo;s fascinating seeing all the knight's armors and
      spears.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>16 EURO. There's no
      need to buy tickets in advance.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong>
      Every day from 9:00 am to 7:30 pm.<br />The ticket office closes at 6:30
      pm.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Duration of tour:</strong> 1-2 hours.<br

      <h2><strong>4. VATICAN MUSEUMS &amp; SISTINE CHAPEL:</strong></h2><p>The
      Vatican Museums displays works from the immense collection amassed by the
      Catholic Church and the papacy throughout the centuries, including several
      of the most renowned Roman sculptures and most important masterpieces of
      Renaissance art in the world.</p><p><strong>​​​Best time to
      visit:</strong> Go as early as possible since it gets really busy and the
      crowds to the Sistine chapel get massively crazy and full. When the
      weather is hot, you don't want to be waiting in a LONG LONG
      line.</p><p><strong>Sistine Chapel:</strong> <em><strong>You are not
      permitted to take photos inside the Sistine Chapel</strong>.</em> Guards
      are reminding you not to photograph. Please respect the rules. Sometimes
      one has to sacrifice amazing photos to not miss the beauty around
      you.</p><p><strong>St Peter's Basilica: </strong><em><strong>You can
      actually enter the Basilica through the Vatican museums.</strong>
      </em>This means once you get to the Sistine chapel, there are two doors,
      <em><strong>the door on the right takes you to St. Peter's
      Basilica,</strong></em> but then there is no way back to the museum. The
      second door on the left takes you back to the museum. This close proximity
      can be a time saver for those on a tight schedule.</p><p><strong>Dress
      code:</strong><strong> </strong>It's a basic code for both <strong>men and
      women.<em> Both need to cover their knees and upper
      arms</em></strong><em>. </em>They prohibit wearing shorts or skirts above
      the knee, sleeveless tops, and low-cut shirts. Men must take their hats
      off before entering, whereas women may continue wearing theirs. This is a
      very holy place for many, and they are very strict about the dress code.
      You could be denied entrance if you do not adhere to the dress
      code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>5. ST. PETER'S BASILICA &amp;
      DOME:</strong></h2><p>St. Peter's Basilica is one of the most beautiful
      churches I have been to. It is the <strong><em>biggest church in the
      world</em> </strong>and was created by artists such as Michelangelo. The
      most exciting attraction here is climbing up the dome and seeing the view
      of the city from up above. In the past, you could purchase tickets for 7
      or 10 EURO to climb the dome, but now if you'd like to go up to the dome,
      you'll have to go with a tour guide. The way up is pretty hard and narrow.
      I wouldn't do it if you suffer from Claustrophobia.</p><p><strong>Dress
      code: </strong>Its basic code is for both <em><strong>men and women both
      need to cover their knees and upper arms</strong>. </em>They prohibit
      wearing shorts or skirts above the knee, sleeveless tops, and low-cut
      shirts. Men must take their hats off before entering, whereas women may
      continue wearing theirs. This is a very holy place for many and they are
      very strict about the dress code. You could be denied entrance if you do
      not dress appropriately.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong><br
      />&bull; Cathedral - Free.<br />&bull; Small-Group St. Peter's Basilica
      Guided Tour - 27 EURO.<br />&bull; St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica Dome: Guided
      Tour - 29 EURO. There are two ways to go up to the Dome The first option
      is by foot 550 steps or take an elevator and walk up only 350
      steps.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day<strong>
      </strong>from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm.<br /><strong>To order

      <h2><strong>6. VICTOR EMMANUEL II MONUMENT:</strong></h2><p>The Victor
      Emmanuel II National Monument, also known as the Mole del Vittoriano or
      simply Vittoriano, is a large national monument built between 1885 and
      1935 to honor Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of unified Italy, It
      occupies a site between the Piazza Venezia and the Capitoline Hill. This

      definitely worth visiting. From the top of the fa&ccedil;ade, the views of
      the city center are magnificent.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong>
      Free.<br /><strong>Elevator to the rooftop: </strong>12 EURO if you'd like
      to take the elevator to the roof for a panoramic view of the Roman Forum
      and Colosseum.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Both Elevator and
      museum are open daily from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm (last entry is 6:00 pm).</p>

      <h2><strong>7. BORGHESE GALLERY AND GARDENS:</strong></h2><p>The Galleria
      Borghese is an art gallery in Rome housed in the former Villa Borghese
      Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its
      gardens, but nowadays, the Villa Borghese gardens are considered a
      separate tourist attraction and are free. The Villa Borghese gallery is
      underrated but such a gem. We really enjoyed our visit there and recommend
      you visit.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 21 EURO. Better order
      tickets in advance we almost missed this and we ordered the tickets
      <strong>two months before</strong>!!<strong><em> </em></strong><br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Tuesday-Sunday
      from 9 am to 7 pm. (No entry after 5 pm).<br /><strong>To order

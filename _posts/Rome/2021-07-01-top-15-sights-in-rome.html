    There's a reason why Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world.
    Renowned as the birthplace of gelato and the home to the Colosseum, the
    eternal city of Rome offers so much. We loved the history, food, culture,

      <h2><strong>1. Trevi Fountain:</strong></h2><p>No trip to Rome is complete
      without visiting Trevi Fountain at least once. The Trevi Fountain is a
      fountain was designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by
      Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3 meters high and 49.15
      meters wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the
      most famous fountains in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When to
      visit:</strong> arrive before 9 am to beat the crowds, or after 8
      pm.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Beware:</strong> Because more than 1,000 people
      visit every hour, the Trevi Fountain is a popular spot for thieves to
      pick-pocket. Make sure to keep your belongings safe!<br /><strong>Night:
      </strong>Once the sun goes down, the fountain lights up, and is truly
      magical.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.&nbsp;<br
      /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>24/7.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2.
      Spanish Steps:</strong></h2><p>From Trevi Fountain, we walked to the
      Spanish steps. The Spanish Steps are a set of steps in Rome, Italy,
      climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza
      Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, dominated by the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti church
      at the top. Avoid afternoons due to overcrowding.</p><p><strong>Do know
      that it is illegal to sit on the steps, and you could be fined for doing
      so!</strong></p>

      <h2><strong>3. La Terrazza del Gianicolo:</strong></h2><p><strong>HIDDEN
      GEM ALERT!</strong> This is the viewpoint above the Trastevere district.
      To get here, you need to climb up the highest hill in the city but don't
      worry, it'll be worth it! The fantastic skyline of the city, the
      multi-hued buildings, the greenery all around, and the beautiful streets
      are just perfect.</p><p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Sunset.<br
      /><strong>How to get there:</strong> You could take a bus or drive up
      here, but the best way to explore and find hidden gems is to walk
      around.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> 24/7.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4.
      Trastevere:</strong></h2><p>On the opposite bank of the river Tiber lies
      the old working-class neighborhood of Rome. Trastevere is a typical
      Italian neighborhood where you can get lost in a maze of narrow streets,
      see old medieval houses, and go for a lively night out in the area's many
      restaurants and bars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>5. The
      Pantheon:</strong></h2><p>The Pantheon (Latin: Pantheum) in Rome is a
      former Roman temple that was completed in 125 CE. It is the only ancient
      Roman building that has remained intact throughout the centuries. Built on
      the site of an earlier temple, Marcus Agrippa was commissioned during the
      reign of Augustus. It was then rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian. Here are a
      few interesting facts about the Pantheon:1. It is about 2,000 years old.2.
      The building was built with a huge 45 meters dome - an amazing
      architectural achievement for the days of ancient Rome. The dome's weight
      is 4,535 tonnes!3. It was the first temple built for the "common people,"
      which was <strong>uncommon</strong>. Temples in ancient times were for
      priests.</p><p>The name "Pantheon" is from the Ancient Greek meaning "all
      the gods"</p><p>The huge Pantheon dome has been the largest in the world
      for 1300 years and to this day is the largest dome in the world.</p><p>An
      amazing effect can be seen each year on <strong>April 21 </strong>when the
      sun's rays enter the oculus and create a disk of light at the entrance of
      the doorway. Rome's birthday is celebrated on April 21, and it is believed
      that on that day, Emperor Hadrian wanted to stand at the temple entrance,
      with his body bathed in golden sunlight, as if the gods were calling him
      from above to join them.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day 9:00 am to 7:00 pm (last entry
      6:30 pm).</p>

      <h2><strong>6. Castel Sant'Angelo:</strong></h2><p>Legend has it that the
      name of the castle was given after the Archangel Michael appeared at the
      top of the castle, sheathing his sword and, with that, ending the plague
      of 590 which tormented Rome. An imposing statue of an angel can be seen on
      top of the castle. People tend to skip going inside, but I highly
      recommend not it&rsquo;s fascinating seeing all the knight's armors and
      spears.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>16 EURO. There's no need to
      buy tickets in advance.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day
      from 9:00 am to 7:30 pm. The ticket office closes at 6:30 pm.<br
      /><strong>Duration of tour:</strong> 1-2 hours.<br /><strong>Best time to
      visit:</strong> Sunset.<br /><strong>To order tickets:</strong><a
      href="https://www.castel-sant-angelo-ticket.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAip-PBhDVARIsAPP2xc0hSq13sbb-9_fddtPDpwpJEP92IpKWTbhbMm42GSV2jmZ-pLUlFCsaAoN1EALw_wcB"><strong>
      </strong><strong>click here!</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>7.
      St. Peter's Basilica &amp; St. Peter's Basilica Dome:</strong></h2><p>St.
      Peter's Basilica is one of the most beautiful churches I have been to. It
      is the <strong>biggest church in the world </strong>and was created by
      artists such as Michelangelo. The most exciting attraction here is
      climbing up the dome and seeing the view of the city from up above. In the
      past, you could purchase tickets for 7 or 10 EURO to climb the dome, but
      now if you'd like to go up to the dome, you'll have to go with a tour
      guide. The way up is pretty hard and narrow. I wouldn't do it if you
      suffer from Claustrophobia.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dress code: </strong>It's
      a basic code for both <strong>men and women. Both need to cover their
      knees and upper arms</strong>. They prohibit wearing shorts or skirts
      above the knee, sleeveless tops, and low-cut shirts. Men must take their
      hats off before entering, whereas women may continue wearing theirs. This
      is a very holy place for many, and they are very strict about the dress
      code. You could be denied entrance if you do not adhere to the dress
      code.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong><br />&bull; Cathedral - Free.<br
      />&bull; Small-Group St. Peter's Basilica Guided Tour - 27 EURO.<br
      />&bull; St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica Dome: Guided Tour - 29 EURO. There are
      two ways to go up to the Dome The first option is by foot 550 steps or
      take an elevator and walk up only 350 steps.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Every day<strong> </strong>from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm.<br
      /><strong>To order tickets:</strong><a

      Piazza Navona:</strong></h2><p>Piazza Navona is one of the most beautiful
      squares in the world. It is so lively with restaurants, performances, and
      stunning architecture. You can easily spend a few hours witnessing the
      activities at this square in the heart of the city. This is a great place
      to grab lunch but do know that the prices in the restaurants here are high
      due to its unique location.</p>

      <h2><strong>9. Borghese Gallery and Gardens:</strong></h2><p><strong>THE
      GALLERIA BORGHESE: </strong></p><p>This is an art gallery in Rome housed
      in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building
      was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays, the Villa Borghese gardens
      are considered a separate tourist attraction and are free. The Villa
      Borghese gallery is underrated but such a gem. We really enjoyed our visit
      there and recommend you visit.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 21
      EURO. Better order tickets in advance we almost missed this, and ordered
      the tickets <strong>two months before</strong>!!<br /><strong>Opening

      pm. (No entry after 5 pm).<br /><strong>To order tickets,</strong><a

      <h2><strong>13. The Vatican Museums &amp; Sistine
      Chapel:</strong></h2><p>The Vatican Museums displays works from the
      immense collection amassed by the Catholic Church and the papacy
      throughout the centuries, including several of the most renowned Roman
      sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the
      world.</p><p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Go as early as possible
      since it gets really busy and the crowds to the Sistine chapel get
      massively crazy and full. When the weather is hot, you don't want to be
      waiting in a LONG LONG line.</p><p><strong>Sistine Chapel:</strong>
      <strong>You are not permitted to take photos inside the Sistine
      Chapel</strong>. Guards are reminding you not to photograph. Please
      respect the rules. Sometimes one has to sacrifice amazing photos to not
      miss the beauty around you.</p><p><strong>St Peter's Basilica:</strong>
      <strong>You can actually enter the Basilica through the Vatican
      museums.</strong> This means once you get to the Sistine chapel, there are
      two doors, <strong>the door on the right takes you to St. Peter's
      Basilica,</strong> but then there is no way back to the museum. The second
      door on the left takes you back to the museum. This close proximity can be
      a time saver for those on a tight schedule.</p><p><strong>Entrance
      Fee:</strong> There are a few ways to order tickets, the best being
      <strong>online</strong>. The lines at the Vatican booths are extremely
      long. Best to order tickets for this in advance since they tend to
      get<strong> sold out quickly</strong>.<br />&bull; Vatican Museums and
      Sistine Chapel (at the booth) 17 EURO.<br />&bull; Vatican Museums and
      Sistine Chapel book ONLINE - 21 EURO.<br />&bull; If you would like to add
      an Audio guide, that is another 7 EURO per person.<br /><strong>Duration
      of tour:</strong> Expect to spend half a day here. There is just so much
      to see.<br /><strong>For a full Guide on the Vatican City that includes
      dress code &amp; important tips:</strong><a

      Giardino Deli Aranci:</strong></h2><p>The Orange Trees Garden is the name
      used in Rome to describe the Parco Savello. It is about 7,800 square
      meters and is located on Aventine Hill. This tucked-away garden is a great
      place to relax and enjoy the beautiful panoramic view of the city. It's
      filled with orange trees, and plenty of places to sit and shade.
      <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Sunsets are the best, so better come
      early and reserve a spot.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day from 7 am to 6
      pm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>15. Piazza del
      Popolo:</strong></h2><p>Piazza del Popolo is a large urban square in Rome.
      The name in modern Italian literally means "People's Square," but
      historically it derives from the poplars after which the church of Santa
      Maria del Popolo, in the northeast corner of the piazza, takes its name.
      <strong>It's a very underrated</strong> and relaxing square. We just
      walked around and enjoyed the sculptures around the
      area.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong>&nbsp;24/7</p>

      <h2><strong>10. The Colosseum:</strong></h2><p>The Colosseum is an oval
      amphitheater in the center of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the
      Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheater ever built and is
      still the largest standing amphitheater in the world today, despite its
      age. It is one of the World's Wonders and DEFINITELY worth visiting once
      in a lifetime. As you spend time in the Colosseum, you feel like you've
      gone back in time. The decision to purchase tickets for the "full tour"
      that included not only the arena floor (regular entrance fee) but also a
      Panoramic view and underground view with a small group including a great
      tour guide, was a wise choice and money well spent. The extra cost allowed
      us backstage, where the exotic animals and gladiators were brought to the
      arena. The Arena - Regular entrance gives you access to the main arena,
      one of the important parts of the Colosseum, where games, battles, and
      shows take place. The underground - Venture into the arena and the
      underground tunnels where gladiators and wild animals awaited to fight.
      Panoramic Terrence - you can admire the Colosseum from its most impressive
      point of view and get amazing photos!</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:
      </strong><br />&bull; Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 18 EURO
      per adult.<br />&bull; Skip-the-Line Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill
      Tour - 30 EURO per adult.<br />&bull; Colosseum Underground, Arena,
      Panoramic Terrence, Roman Forum &amp; Hill Tour - 60 EURO per adult. (What
      we took). This tour is 2-3 hours. <em>It's possible to access the
      Colosseum only at the time chosen during the booking phase, and it's
      suggested to show up at the entrance 15 minutes before the chosen time.
      The entrance to the Colosseum is located at the "Sperone Valadier", near
      the Arch of Constantine.</em><br /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Every
      day. Last admission one hour before closing.January 2nd-February 28th,

      Roman Forum &amp; Palatine Hill:</strong></h2><p>The Roman Forum was the
      center of the ancient Roman Empire. During your visit to the Roman Forum,
      you will walk past Roman excavations and the archaeological park full of
      old temples, arches, market halls and other important buildings built by
      different emperors. Next to the forum lies Palatine Hill, where you will
      find excavations of imperial residences.</p><p><br /><strong>Entrance Fee:
      </strong>Free.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong>
      24/7.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>12. Knights of Malta
      Keyhole:</strong></h2><p><strong>HIDDEN GEM ALERT!</strong> Knights of
      Malta keyhole<strong> </strong>is a very cool photo opportunity that is
      <strong>exactly</strong>&nbsp;what it sounds. There is a keyhole where you
      could capture a beautiful photo of St. Peter's Basilica. You will see
      visitors queue up in front of the impenetrable door to take a peek and
      capture it with their cameras. If you're unaware of this spot, it might
      look bizarre to see people standing in line here. The keyhole is part of
      the property owned by the Priory of the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic
      religious order of crusader knights that originated in Jerusalem in the
      11th century. It is the oldest surviving chivalric order in the world and
      is a sovereign entity under international law. The estate also hosts the
      Embassy of the Order of Malta to Italy.</p><p><strong>Address:</strong>

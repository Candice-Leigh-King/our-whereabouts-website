    Is Rome on your bucketlist? If not, you must add it to your list now!
    There's a reason why Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world.
    Renowned as the birthplace of gelato and the home to the Colosseum, the
    eternal city of Rome offers so much. We loved the history, food, culture,
    and exquisite architecture around every corner, which makes it one of the
    unique cities we have been to. Here is our 1-week itinerary:

      <h2><strong>DAY 1 -<br />TOUR WITH GREGOR:</strong></h2><p>We reserved a
      &ldquo;Photo Shoot Tour&rdquo; with a local named Gregor Morosini Gatti
      (To check out his page<a href="https://www.fotografosemroma.com/"> click
      here!</a>) We enjoyed our time with him. He was one of the highlights of
      our trip to Rome! As we walked around the city, he gave us interesting and
      valuable information we needed and great tips.<br />Places he takes you
      during his tour: Pantheon, Piazza Navona, View of <strong>Castel
      Sant'Angelo, St. Peter&rsquo;s Square, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venezia,
      Campo di Fiori, Terraza del Gianicolo..</strong></p>

      <h2><strong>DAY 2 -<br />ROME SIGHT SEEING:</strong></h2><p>The trick to
      seeing Rome without the crazy crowds is to wake up as early as possible.
      People tend to go out at 9 am, and popular sites are heavily populated
      once they all come out. Walk around Rome and get lost in this beautiful
      city; there is a surprise in each
      corner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Trevi Fountain:</strong></h2><p>No
      trip to Rome is complete without visiting Trevi Fountain at least once.
      The Trevi Fountain is a fountain was designed by Italian architect Nicola
      Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3
      meters high and 49.15 meters wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in
      the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world.<br
      /><strong>When to visit:</strong> arrive before 9 am to beat the crowds,
      or after 8 pm.<br /><strong>Beware:</strong> Because more than 1,000
      people visit every hour, the Trevi Fountain is a popular spot for thieves
      to pick-pocket. Make sure to keep your belongings safe!<br
      /><strong>Night:</strong> Once the sun goes down, the fountain lights up,
      and it is truly magical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Spanish
      Steps:</strong></h2><p>From Trevi Fountain, we walked to the Spanish
      steps. The Spanish Steps are a set of steps in Rome, Italy, climbing a
      steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza
      Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, dominated by the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti church
      at the top. Avoid afternoons due to overcrowding.<br /><strong>Do know
      that it is illegal to sit on the steps, and you could be fined for doing
      so!</strong></p><p>From the Spanish steps, we headed towards Piazza del
      Popolo while admiring the beautiful city and taking
      photos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Piazza del
      Popolo:</strong></h2><p>Piazza del Popolo is a large urban square in Rome.
      The name in modern Italian literally means "People's Square", but
      historically it derives from the poplars after which the church of Santa
      Maria del Popolo, in the northeast corner of the piazza, takes its name.
      It's a very underrated and relaxing square. We just walked around and
      enjoyed the sculptures around the area.</p><p>From Piazza del Popolo, we
      headed towards the Pantheon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The
      Pantheon:</strong></h2><p>The Pantheon (Latin: Pantheum) in Rome is a
      former Roman temple completed in 125 CE. It is the only ancient Roman
      building that has remained intact throughout the centuries. Built on the
      site of an earlier temple, Marcus Agrippa was commissioned during the
      reign of Augustus. It was then rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian.<br />Here
      are a few interesting facts about the Pantheon:<br />&bull;It is about
      2,000 years old.<br />&bull;The building was built with a massive 45
      meters dome - a fantastic architectural achievement for the days of
      ancient Rome. The dome's weight is 4,535 tonnes!<br />&bull;It was the
      first temple built for the "common people," which was
      <strong>uncommon</strong>. Temples in ancient times were for priests.<br
      />&bull;The name "Pantheon" is from the Ancient Greek meaning "all the
      gods."<br />&bull;The huge Pantheon dome has been the largest in the world
      for 1300 years and, to this day, is the largest dome in the world.<br
      />&bull;An amazing effect can be seen each year on <strong>April 21
      </strong>when the sun's rays enter the oculus and create a disk of light
      at the entrance of the doorway. Rome's birthday is celebrated on April 21,
      and it is believed that on that day, Emperor Hadrian wanted to stand at
      the temple entrance, with his body bathed in golden sunlight, as if the
      gods were calling him from above to join them.<br /><strong>Entrance
      Fee:</strong> Free.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day, 9:00
      am to 7:00 pm (last entry 6:30 pm).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 3 -<br
      />COLOSSEUM:</strong></h2><h2><strong>The Colosseum:</strong></h2><p>The
      Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center of the city of Rome,
      Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
      amphitheater ever built and is still the largest standing amphitheater in
      the world today, despite its age. It is one of the World's Wonders and
      worth visiting once in a lifetime. As you spend time in the Colosseum, you
      feel like you've gone back in time. The decision to purchase tickets for
      the "full tour" that included not only the arena floor (regular entrance
      fee) but also a Panoramic view and underground view with a small group
      including a great tour guide, was a wise choice and money well spent. The
      extra cost allowed us backstage, where the exotic animals and gladiators
      were brought to the arena. The Arena - Regular entrance gives you access
      to the main arena, one of the important parts of the Colosseum, where
      games, battles, and shows took place. The underground - Venture into the
      arena and the underground tunnels where gladiators and wild animals
      awaited to fight. Panoramic Terrence - you can admire the Colosseum from
      its most impressive point of view and get amazing photos!<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong><br />&bull; Colosseum, Forum, and
      Palatine Hill Tour - 18 EURO per adult.<br />&bull; Skip-the-Line
      Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 30 EURO per adult.<br />&bull;
      Colosseum Underground, Arena, Panoramic Terrence, Roman Forum &amp; Hill
      Tour - 60 EURO per adult. (What we took). This tour is 2-3 hours.<br
      /><em>It's possible to access in the Colosseum only at the time chosen
      during the booking phase and it's suggested to show up at the entrance 15
      minutes before the chosen time. The entrance to the Colosseum is located
      at the "Sperone Valadier", near the Arch of Constantine.</em><br
      /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Every day. Last admission one hour
      before closing.<br />&bull;January 2nd-February 28th, 2022: From 9:30 am
      to 4:30 pm.<br />&bull;March 1st-26th, 2022: From 9:30 am to 5:30 pm.<br

      ancient Roman Empire. During your visit to the Roman Forum, you will walk
      past Roman excavations and the archaeological park full of old temples,
      arches, market halls and other important buildings built by different

      <h2><strong>DAY 4 -<br />VATICAN MUSEUMS &amp; SISTINE
      CHAPEL:</strong></h2><h2><strong>The Vatican Museums &amp; Sistine
      Chapel:</strong></h2><p>The Vatican Museums displays works from the
      immense collection amassed by the Catholic Church and the papacy
      throughout the centuries, including several of the most renowned Roman
      sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the
      world. Best time to visit: Go to the as early as possible since it gets
      really busy and the crowds to the Sistine chapel get massively crazy and
      full. Sistine Chapel: <strong>You are not permitted to take photos inside
      the Sistine Chapel</strong>. Guards are reminding you not to photograph.
      Please respect the rules. Sometimes one has to sacrifice amazing photos to
      not miss the beauty around you.</p><p>St Peter's Basilica: <strong>You can
      enter the Basilica through the Vatican museums.</strong> This means once
      you get to the Sistine Chapel, there are two doors, <strong>the door on
      the right takes you to St. Peter's Basilica,</strong> but then there is no
      way back to the museum. The second door on the left takes you back to the
      museum. This proximity can be a time saver for those on a tight
      schedule.</p><p>Dress code:<strong> </strong>It's a basic code for both
      <strong>men and women. Both need to cover their knees and upper
      arms</strong>. They prohibit wearing shorts or skirts above the knee,
      sleeveless tops, and low-cut shirts. Men must take their hats off before
      entering, whereas women may continue wearing theirs. This is a very holy
      place for many, who are very strict about the dress code. You could be
      denied entrance if you do not adhere to the dress code.</p><p>Food: They
      have a food court on the second floor with great pizza and good fruit
      salads. It cost 22 EURO for 2 large drinks, 3 slices of pizza and 2 fruit
      salads.</p><p>Backpacks: Big bulky backpacks are not allowed in, even if
      the backpack is half empty. They make you put the backpack in storage. Try
      to bring small bags and purses.<br /><strong>Entrance
      Fee:</strong><strong> </strong>There are a few ways to order tickets, the
      best being buying online since the lines at the Vatican booths are
      extremely long. Best to order tickets for this in advance since they tend
      to get sold out quickly.<br />&bull; Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel
      (at the booth) 17 EURO.<br />&bull; Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel
      book ONLINE - 21 EURO.<br />&bull; If you would like to add an Audio guide
      that is another 7 EURO per person.<br /><strong>Duration of tour:</strong>
      Expect to spend half a day here. There is just so much to see.<strong> For

      Sant'Angelo:</strong></h2><p>Legend has it that the name of the castle was
      given after the Archangel Michael appeared at the top of the castle
      sheathing his sword and with that, ending the plague of 590 which
      tormented Rome. An imposing statue of an angel can be seen on top of the
      castle. People tend to skip going inside but I highly recommend not
      it&rsquo;s fascinating seeing all the knight's armors and spears.<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>16 EURO. There's no need to buy tickets
      in advance.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day from 9:00 am to
      7:30 pm.<br />The ticket office closes at 6:30 pm.<br /><strong>Duration

      5 -<br />ST. PETER'S BASILICA:</strong></h2><h2><strong>St. Peter's
      Basilica:</strong></h2><p>St. Peter's Basilica is one of the most
      beautiful churches I have been to. It is the <strong>biggest church in the
      world </strong>and was created by artists such as Michelangelo. The most
      exciting attraction here is climbing up the dome and seeing the view of
      the city from up above. In the past, you were able to purchase tickets for
      7 or 10 EURO to climb the dome, but now if you'd like to go up to the dome
      you'll have to go with a tour guide. The way up is pretty hard and narrow.
      I wouldn't do it if you suffer from Claustrophobia Dress code:<strong>
      </strong>It's a basic code for both <strong>men and women. Both need to
      cover their knees and upper arms</strong>. They prohibit wearing shorts or
      skirts above the knee, sleeveless tops, and low-cut shirts. Men must take
      their hats off before entering whereas women may continue wearing theirs.
      This is a very holy place for many and they are very strict about the
      dress code. You could be denied entrance if you do not adhere to the dress
      code.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong><br />&bull; Cathedral - Free.<br
      />&bull; Small-Group St. Peter's Basilica Guided Tour - 27 EURO.<br
      />&bull; St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica Dome: Guided Tour - 29 EURO. There are
      two ways to go up to the Dome The first option is by foot 550 steps or
      take an elevator and walk up only 350 steps.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Every day<strong> </strong>from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm.<br

      </strong><strong>Click
      here!</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Piazza
      Navona:</strong></h2><p>Piazza Navona is one of the most beautiful squares
      in the world. It is so lively with restaurants, performances and stunning
      architecture. You can easily spend a few hours witnessing the activities
      at this square in the heart of the city. This is a great place to grab
      lunch but do know that the prices in the restaurants here are high due to
      it's unique location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 6 -<br />UNDERRATED
      SPOTS IN ROME:</strong></h2><h2><strong>Roseto di Roma
      Capitale:</strong></h2><p>We started our morning in <strong>Roseto di Roma
      Capitale</strong> which is the Rose garden on the way to <strong>Giardino
      Deli Aranci</strong>. Rome Rose Garden is a public garden located opposite
      the Circus Maximus on the Aventine Hill. The park was established in 1931.
      Over 1100 varieties of roses are grown there, many of them gifts from
      countries around the world.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Generally the opening of the Roseto
      Garden takes place during spring flowering from late April to May and
      autumn flowering in October.</p><h2><strong>Knights of Malta
      Keyhole:</strong></h2><p><strong>HIDDEN GEM ALERT!</strong> From there we
      walked to the <strong>Knights of Malta keyhole </strong>which is a very
      cool photo opportunity that sounds <strong>exactly</strong> like it
      sounds. There is a keyhole where you could capture a beautiful photo of
      St. Peter's Basilica. You will see visitors queue up in front of the
      impenetrable door to take a peek, and capture it with their camera. If
      you're unaware of this spot, it might look bizarre to see people standing
      in line here. The keyhole is part of the property owned by the Priory of
      the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic religious order of crusader knights
      that originated in Jerusalem in the 11th century. It is the oldest
      surviving chivalric order in the world and is a sovereign entity under
      international law. The estate also hosts the embassy of the Order of Malta
      to Italy.<br /><strong>Address:</strong> Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta, 3,
      00153 Roma RM, Italy. Open 24/7.</p><h2><strong>Giardino Deli
      Aranci:</strong></h2><p>The Orange Trees Garden is the name used in Rome
      to describe the Parco Savello. It is about 7,800 square meters and is
      located on the Aventine Hill. This tucked away garden, is a great place to
      relax and enjoy the beautiful panoramic view of the city. It's filled with
      orange trees, there are plenty of places to sit, and shade.<br
      /><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Sunsets are the best so better come
      early and reserve a spot.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Every day from 7am to 6
      pm.</p><h2><strong>Victor Emmanuel II Monument:</strong></h2><p>The Victor
      Emmanuel II National Monument, also known as the Mole del Vittoriano or
      simply Vittoriano, is a large national monument built between 1885 and
      1935 to honor Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of unified Italy, It
      occupies a site between the Piazza Venezia and the Capitoline Hill. This
      is a spot that most skip but squeeze it in your schedule. It's definitely
      worth visiting. From the top of the fa&ccedil;ade the views of the city
      center are magnificent.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Elevator to rooftop: </strong>12 EURO if you'd like to take the
      elevator to the roof for a panoramic view of the Roman Forum and
      Colosseum.<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Both Elevator and museum
      are open daily from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm (last entry 6:00
      pm).</p><h2><strong>Rome Opera House:</strong></h2><p>In the evening we
      went to see the ballet in the official Rome Opera house. Want your heart
      to burst with passion? Enjoy ballet. If you have never seen ballet, you
      are in for a delicious treat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 7 -<br
      />VILLA BORGHESE:&nbsp;</strong></h2><h2><strong>Borghese
      Gallery:</strong></h2><p>The Galleria Borghese is an art gallery in Rome,
      housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery
      building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese
      gardens are considered a separate tourist attraction and are free. The
      Villa Borghese gallery is underrated but such a gem. We really enjoyed our
      visit there and recommend you visit.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong>
      21 EURO. Better order tickets in advance we almost missed this and we
      ordered the tickets <strong>two months before</strong>!!<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Tuesday-Sunday
      from 9 am to 7 pm. (No entry after 5 pm).<br /><strong>To order

      <p>When we booked our trip, we were told that 7 days is way too long to
      spend in Rome. Did we listen to them? Mm, no. We decided to discover this
      magical city through all our senses truly.</p>

      <h2><strong>4. The Vatican Museums &amp; Sistine
      Chapel:</strong></h2><p>The Vatican Museums has a display of works from
      the immense collection amassed by the Catholic Church and the papacy
      throughout the centuries, including several of the most renowned Roman
      sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the
      world. There are 54 galleries ranging from classical antiquities and
      Ancient Egyptian pieces up to modern religious art. The most famous is of
      course the Sistine Chapel, which is famously the last gallery before
      exiting the museum. You could easily spend days lost in the many hallways
      and rooms filled with masterpieces when you visit the
      Vatican.</p><p><strong>BEST TIME TO VISIT:</strong><br />Tuesday-Friday
      are the best days to visit. Go to the as early as possible since it gets
      really busy and the crowds to the Sistine chapel get massively crowded. If
      you aren't able to visit early in the morning try visiting late in the
      afternoon. Go as early as possible since it gets really busy and the
      crowds to the Sistine chapel get massively crazy and full. When the
      weather is hot, you don't want to be waiting in a LONG LONG
      line.</p><p>Avoid going in the summer since there is no air conditioning
      and the crowds definitely don't help with that.</p><p><strong>SISTINE
      CHAPEL:<br />You are not permitted to take photos inside the Sistine
      Chapel</strong>. There are guards reminding you not to photograph. Please
      respect the rules. Sometimes one has to sacrifice amazing photos in order
      not to miss the beauty around you.</p><p><strong>ST. PETER'S BASILICA:<br
      />You can actually enter the Basilica through the Vatican
      museums.</strong> This means once you get to the Sistine chapel there are
      two doors, <strong>the door on the right takes you to St. Peter's
      Basilica</strong> but then there is no way back to the museum. The second
      door on the left takes you back to the museum. This close proximity can be
      a time saver for those on a tight schedule.</p><p><strong>DRESS
      CODE:</strong><br />Its a basic code for both <strong>men and women. Both
      need to cover their knees and upper arms</strong>. They prohibit wearing
      shorts or skirts above the knee, sleeveless tops, and low-cut shirts. Men
      must take their hats off before entering whereas women may continue
      wearing theirs. This is a very holy place for many and they are very
      strict about the dress code. You could be denied entrance if you do not
      adhere to the dress code.</p><p><strong>FOOD:</strong><br />They have a
      food court on the second floor with great pizza and good fruit salads. It
      cost 22€ for 2 large drinks, 3 slices of pizza and 2 fruit
      salads.</p><p><strong>BACKPACKS:</strong><br />Big bulky backpacks are not
      allowed in, even if the backpack is half empty. They make you put the
      backpack in storage. Try to bring small bags and
      purses.</p><p><strong>ENTRANCE FEE:</strong><br />There are a few ways to
      order tickets, the best being <strong>online</strong>. The lines at the
      Vatican booths are extremely long. Best to order tickets for this in
      advance since they tend to get<strong> sold out quickly</strong>.<br
      />•Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel (at the booth) 17 EURO.<br
      />•Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel book ONLINE - 21 EURO.<br />•If you
      would like to add an Audio guide that is another 7 EURO per
      person.</p><p><strong>OPENING HOURS:</strong><br />Monday-Saturday from
      9:00 am to 6:00 pm (with the last entry at 4:00
      pm).</p><p><strong>DURATION OF TOUR:</strong><br />Expect to spend half a
      day here. There is just so much to see.</p><p><a

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>5. St. Peter's Basilica:</strong></h2><p>St. Peter's Basilica is one of the most beautiful churches I have been to. It is the <strong>biggest church in the world </strong>and was created by artists such as Michelangelo.</p><p>\_</p><p><strong>THE DOME:</strong><br />The most exciting attraction here is climbing up the dome and seeing the view of the city from up above. In the past, you were able to purchase tickets for 7 or 10 EURO to climb the dome, but now if you'd like to go up to the dome you'll have to go with a tour guide. The way up is pretty hard and narrow. I wouldn't do it if you suffer from Claustrophobia.</p><p>\_</p><p><strong>BEST TIME TO VISIT:</strong><br />Best time to visit is week-days except for Wednesday. Come as early as possible, Entrance is free but you need to pass security and the line gets larger and larger as the day goes by.</p><p>\_</p><p><strong>DRESS CODE:</strong><br />It's a basic code is for both <strong>men and women.

St. Peter's Square:</strong></h2><p>St. Peter's Square is a large plaza located directly in front of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City, the papal enclave inside Rome, directly west of the neighborhood of Borgo. Both the square and the basilica are named after Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus considered by Catholics to be the first Pope.</p><p>It is one of the <strong>largest and most break-taking squares in the world</strong>. Ironic, since it's located in the smallest country in the world.</p><p>The most impressive part of the square, besides its size, are its 284 columns and 88 pilasters that flank the square in a colonnade of four rows. Above the columns there are <strong>140 statues of saints</strong> created in 1670 by the disciples of Bernini.</p>"

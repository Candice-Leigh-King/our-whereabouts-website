      <p>Cozumel, which is an island in the Caribbean Sea off the eastern coast
      of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. It is a popular cruise ship port and is
      known for its beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters, and vibrant marine
      life.</p><p>Cozumel is also a popular destination for scuba diving and
      snorkeling due to its location along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the
      second-largest coral reef system in the world.</p><p>If you're looking for
      a place to stay, I'd consider Grand Park Royal.</p>

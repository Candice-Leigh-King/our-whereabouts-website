      <h3><strong>OUR EXPERIENCE:</strong></h3><p>We had 5 nights in Budapest
      and knew we wanted a great location and comfort, but we weren't looking
      for anything more since we barely spent any time in the hotel. We took
      this hotel and loved
      it.</p><h3><strong>LOCATION:</strong></h3><p>&bull;1051 Budapest, Dorottya
      utca 8., Hungary.<br />&bull;40-50 minute drive from Budapest Airport.<br
      />&bull;Metro access from the property.<br />&bull;4-minute walk to the
      famous Fashion Street in
      Budapest.</p><h3><strong>PARKING:</strong></h3><p>No parking is
      available.</p>

      <h3><strong>HOTEL DETAILS:</strong></h3><p>The <strong>D8 Hotel</strong>
      is a 3-star superior lifestyle hotel located in <strong>the heart of
      Budapest</strong>, 400 m from Chain Bridge and 400m from fashion street.
      They have 137 rooms, a restaurant, and a lounge bar. Their design is
      cheerful and modern.</p><h3><strong>ROOM TYPE WE STAYED
      IN:</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Standard Queen Room.</em></strong><br
      />The room has a modern design with cheerful colors. Each room has
      air-conditioning, a safety deposit box, a hair dryer, a TV, and a clothes
      rack.<br /><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> The rooms were spotless. This is
      one of the cleanest hotels we've been to.<br /><strong>Comfort:</strong>
      The beds were a little stiff but overall not so bad. The room is also
      relatively small (15 m&sup2;), but we
      managed.</p><h3><strong>PRICE:</strong></h3><p>The average cost is 80$ per
      night.</p><h3><strong>COMFORT LEVEL:</strong></h3><p>8/10! The beds
      weren't the most comfortable, and the layout of the space was pretty
      small, but the location made up for it. Everything was within walking
      distance and made it very easy for us to explore the
      city.</p><h3><strong>VIEWS TO EXPECT ON PROPERTY:</strong></h3><p>There is
      a view of the street/courtyard, which usually isn't so appealing, but they
      were able to design
      beautifully.</p><h3><strong>DINING:</strong></h3><p>Breakfast is included
      in the price. They have a buffet at their classy restaurant with a variety
      of gluten and lactose-free foods.<br />Lounge bar: After a long day
      exploring outside, it's nice to kick back with a nice
      cocktail.</p><h3><strong>STAFF:</strong></h3><p>The Staff was extra
      friendly and helpful. They helped us book activities and provided us with
      tips and valuable information.</p><h3><strong>BEST SEASON TO
      VISIT</strong></h3><p>The best times to visit Budapest are from
      <strong>March-May and September-November</strong>. These shoulder seasons
      are when the weather is idyllic, and the city isn't overcrowded with
      tourists. However, we visited in January and enjoyed it so much!! Yes, it
      was freezing, but Budapest is just as magical, and we got to enjoy the hot
      baths that way!</p>

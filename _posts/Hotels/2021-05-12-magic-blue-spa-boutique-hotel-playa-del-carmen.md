      average cost is 110$ per
      night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>COMFORT
      LEVEL:</strong></h2><p>9/10! The bed was large and comfortable, the layout
      of the space was good and the pool was beautiful and
      fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>VIEWS TO EXPECT ON
      PROPERTY:</strong></h2><p>The hotel is located on the famous avenue so
      there isn't an ocean or outdoors view, but since the property is filled
      with palm trees and planet that make you feel like you're in an exotic
      paradise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DINING:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Breakfast:
      When staying here you breakfast is included in the price. The breakfast
      had are large variety of food, which we really enjoyed.</li><li>They have
      great deals with Brazilian Rodizio style restaurant which is located right
      near the hotel if you would like to get fine steak and
      drinks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>ACCOMMODATIONS AND
      AMENITIES:</strong></h2><p>Magic Blue Spa Boutique Hotel features a great
      outdoor pool, hot tub and pool snack-bar with sun lounge beds where guests
      can relax and enjoy drinks, cocktails and light

      soon.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>STAFF:</strong></h2><p>The staff
      was always so kind and welcoming, made us feel at home every time we
      walked back into the hotel after a long day of exploring around. They were
      also very helpful with any information we
      needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BEST SEASON TO
      VISIT:</strong></h2><p>We stayed here at the beginning of September. The
      best season to visit is between April and October as there are fewer
      people around and the weather is most ideal. The temperatures are also
      between 20-26 Celsius.</p>

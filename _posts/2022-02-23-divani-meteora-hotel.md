    OUR EXPERIENCE:

    We had 3 nights in Meteora. Before we arrived we wanted a hotel that offers
    a great location, relaxation, and comfort. Divani Meteora is the perfect
    hotel to pamper yourself while sightseeing and enjoying magnificent views of
    Meteora.

      SEASON TO VISIT</strong></h3><p>The best time to visit Meteora is in late
      spring (March to May) or autumn (September to November) when the crowds
      are less hectic. We visited in February and enjoyed it too. Greek winter
      weather can be downright warm. Yes, in the northern region it could snow
      or rain but the temperature shouldn't be too bad if you're lucky. We
      visited a week after a snowstorm and during the morning and night it was
      cold (6c) but mid-day it was sunny and warm.</p>

      <p>Meteora is a whole different world, you won't find anything on google
      maps or Waze besides the monasteries; you have to drive around and find
      the views you like best. If you are in a rush and don't have time to
      <strong>find </strong>the best viewpoints and cool photo locations, this
      post is for you. Each viewpoint has a bit of a different angle, but
      they&rsquo;re all breathtaking. They&rsquo;re not guarded, so visit at
      your own risk.</p>

      <h2><strong>VIEWPOINTS YOU'LL FIND IN GOOGLE
      MAPS/WAZE:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>'Meteora Observation
      Deck':</h2><p>This is a pretty popular spot and is also known as Sunrise
      rock.</p><p>When it says Deck, don't expect an actual deck. There are 3
      parking spots (max 5 cars can fit in here), once you park your car you
      walk/climb on rocks to reach a beautiful spot where you can sit and watch
      the sunrise.<br /><em><strong>Coordinates: 39.719302,
      21.637243</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>View in Meteora:</h2><p>While
      driving from Varlaam Monastery towards the Holy Trinity Monastery, you'll
      see a small observation point on the right side of the road.<br
      /><em><strong>Coordinates: 39.718103,

      <h2><strong>VIEWS YOU WON'T FIND IN GOOGLE
      MAPS/WAZE:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Sunset rock:</h2><p>This was our
      favorite spot to watch the sunset, and I guess others agree since this
      spot is also known as Sunset rock.<br />It isn't difficult to get to but
      do know that the rock I'm standing on in this photo isn't connected to the
      viewpoint, and you'll need to jump a little to reach it.<br />There are 3
      parking spots (max 5 cars can fit in here) so arrive early.<br
      /><em><strong>Coordinates: 39.721378,
      21.634522</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Meteora Rocks:</h2><p>While
      driving from Varlaam to St. Nicholas, we found this beautiful spot and
      decided to stop and take a photo here. There are quite a few parking spots
      here, but it still doesn't have a name.<br /><em><strong>Coordinates:
      39.720124, 21.631486</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>View of Varlaam
      &amp; Rousanou Monasteries:</h2><p>If you park your car at Varlamm and
      walk in the opposite direction you'll a path that leads to this really
      cute spot where you can see the view of Varlaam monastery and if you are
      daring enough to walk on the left side of the path, you'll find a gorgeous
      view of Rousanou Monastery.<br /><em><strong>Coordinates: 39.725934,
      21.632542</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Varlaam Monastery:</h2><p>Park
      at the Great Meteoron parking lot and walk back down the road towards
      Varlaam. Turn right onto the grassy verge between Varlaam and Great
      Meteoron and walk down the path below.<br /><em><strong>Coordinates:
      39.726326, 21.629323</strong></em></p>

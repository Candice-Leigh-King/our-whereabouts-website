      <h2>Best time to visit</h2><p>The best time is in the shoulder season,
      which is <strong>April-May</strong> and
      <strong>September-October.</strong> During these months the weather is
      still warm enough and you'll be able to beat the summer
      crowds.</p><p>Depending on the year, there may still be snow in May and it
      might start snowing as early as September, so do check the weather before
      you go.</p><p>Be aware that during the winter season some of the mountains
      in the Dolomites are used as ski slopes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to
      stay</h2><p>The Dolomites is located across three Northern Italian regions
      and five Italian provinces. Those three regions are Veneto, Trentino
      Alto-Adige/S&uuml;dtirol, and Friuli Venezia Giulia. It is an enormous
      alpine area and trying to decide where to stay can be a little
      overwhelming.</p><p>When trying to decide where to stay, ask yourself what
      are the hikes/sites you would like to see and how many days will you be
      staying in the Dolomites.</p><p>The popular locations aren't near each
      other therefore there are a few options on where to stay</p><p>Stay in
      different areas and move every night -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>
      you'll be near the attractions,</p><ul><li><strong>Cons</strong> It's
      pretty tiring to move from one hotel to another, every night.</li><li>Stay
      in 2 different areas - It&rsquo;s far better to <strong>choose
      two</strong>, where you can divide your time equally.</li><li>Base
      yourself in one area but expect to do a lot of driving. That is what we
      did.</li></ul>

      <h2>Things to know before your trip</h2><h3>1. Language</h3><p>In the
      Dolomites, most places have two different names, because a large area of
      the Dolomites is located in a region that was part of the Austro-Hungarian
      Empire until WWI when it officially became part of Italy. For this reason,
      until today, most places in the region of Alto Adige (in Italian) / South
      Tyrol (in German) have two different names, one in each
      language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. South Tyrolians</h3><p>Those who live in
      South Tyrol don't consider themselves Italian nor German, They Prefer to
      be called South Tyrolians. If you call them German or Italian, they may
      find it offensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Rent a car</h3><p>The best way
      to get around in the Dolomites is by car! Getting around by public
      transportation isn't easy in the Dolomites and if you truly want to
      experience this area to its fullest you need to rent a
      car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Weather</h3><p>The Dolomite Mountains offer
      some of the best weather in all of the Alps, perfect for year-round.
      Saying that it is important to <strong>always</strong> check the forecast
      beforehand and don&rsquo;t underestimate the weather.&nbsp; Take into
      consideration that the valleys will be warmer while the mountains will get
      colder and could get very foggy.</p><ul><li>Summer (June-September): Warm
      temperatures and plenty of sun which is perfect for any activity. While
      the average maximum temperature may reach some 25 degrees Celsius, there
      is a nice breeze.</li><li>Fall (September-November): The temperature
      drops, but weather conditions remain stable and pleasant.</li><li>Winter
      (December-March): Snow usually begins to accumulate during these months
      and is very popular for those looking to do winter sports.</li><li>Spring
      (April-May): During these months it gets warmer, but it also rains. It's a
      great time to visit since the spring brings beautiful green valleys and
      pastures overflowing with wildflowers.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>5.
      Gear</h3><p>Hiking in the Dolomites can be challenging, even the most
      experienced hiker may find the hikes there challenging. Don&rsquo;t
      underestimate the importance of good and sturdy hiking boots. Hiking
      sticks can also come in handy since some of the trails are narrow, have
      small slippery rocks, and have sheer drops with nowhere to hold
      unto.</p><p>Also, since the weather is unpredictable, I would use the
      onion layer method (layered outfits are your best
      friend).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Avoid crowds</h3><p>The Dolomites has
      become famous over the years (thanks to social media), therefore expect
      crowds even during the early mornings. Wake up as early as possible so you
      can really enjoy the beautiful nature without
      crowds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Best time for photography</h3><p>There is
      something about the sunsets/sunrises in the Alps, they are almost pink. If
      you are looking to capture beautiful photos in the Dolomites, aim for
      sunrise and sunsets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8. Carry small change</h3><p>The
      Dolomites has small villages and most places don't accept credit cards,
      <strong>cash only</strong>.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>9. Expenses</h3><p>Italy
      isn't the cheapest destination, the Dolomites is no exception. If you take
      our Venice from the exception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Expenses:&nbsp;
      2,016$ (6,363 NIS).</strong></h3><p><strong>Flights:</strong> From
      Tel-Aviv to Venice, it cost us 243 USD for both of us, including a
      suitcase.</p><p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> 482.5 USD for 3 nights in
      a 4-star hotel.</p><p><strong>Car rental:</strong> 315.7
      USD.</p><p><strong>Gas:</strong> 106 USD.</p><p><strong>Travel
      Insurance:</strong> 122.8 USD.</p><p><strong>Covid-19 tests:</strong>
      324.6 USD.</p><p><strong>Food:</strong>&nbsp; 160
      USD.</p><p><strong>Activities:</strong> 322.5 USD.</p>

      <h2>How long should you stay</h2><p>We spent 4 days in the Dolomites but
      would recommend staying for at least 6 days.</p><p>The Dolomites is such a
      large area and there is so much to see and so much to do that you should
      give it at least 6 days, if possible spend 9 days
      here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What to do</h3><p><strong>Best
      Lakes:</strong> Lago di Carezza, Lago di Braies, and Lago di
      Misurina.</p><p><strong>Popular Hikes:</strong> Tre Cime di Lavaredo,
      Cadini di Misurina, Lago di Sorapis, Cinque Torri, Seceda, Lago di Braies,
      Alpe di Siusi.</p><p><strong>Best spots for sunrise/sunset:</strong> Val
      di Funes, Alpe di Siusi, Lago di Braies, and
      Seceda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What to pack</h3><ul><li>Depending on when you
      go, it could get pretty cold here. The most important thing to help you is
      <strong>layers!</strong> Even if it's sunny outside and the weather
      predictions say it'll be warm, I would have an extra layer in your
      backpack because things can change quickly up in the
      mountains.</li><li>Bring <strong>suitable hiking shoes</strong>. Since
      most of the activities in the Dolomites include hikes do not underestimate
      the importance of good shoes. Even hikes that are considered easy might
      not be as easy as you're used to.</li><li>If you've got hiking sticks
      those could definitely come in handy in some of the hikes here.</li></ul>

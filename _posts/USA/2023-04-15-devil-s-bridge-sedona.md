      <h2><strong>Final Tips:</strong></h2><p>•Go to the restroom before the
      hike because the only parking lot that has a pit toilet is Dry Creek
      Road.</p><p>• Devil's Bridge is not as narrow as it looks in photos but
      there are no rails on the sides of the arch, so be careful as you walk
      across.</p>

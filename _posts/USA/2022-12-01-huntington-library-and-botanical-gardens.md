      <h2>Things to do:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;The Huntington Library - It has more
      than 430,000 rare books &amp; millions of manuscripts!<br
      />&bull;Huntington Art Gallery - This gallery displays European Art<br
      />&bull;Virginia Steele Scott Galleries - This gallery displays&nbsp;
      American Art</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Gardens:&nbsp;</h3><p>There are a total
      of 16 gardens! Sadly we didn't have time to visit them all but here are
      the ones you shouldn't miss:</p><p>&bull;Desert Garden - This is a must
      because it's one of the oldest and largest cacti and succulent collections
      in the world.<br />&bull;Japanese Garden - I absolutely loved the Japanese
      garden. It closely resembled the authentic Gardens in Japan.<br
      />&bull;Chinese Garden - This garden was just as beautiful as the Japanese
      Garden. It has plants,&nbsp; flowers, and lakes.<br />&bull;Rose Garden -
      he garden was designed primarily for display, providing copious quantities
      of cut blooms for the large elaborate floral arrangements favored in their
      home. Household records indicate that in one year alone more than 30,000
      flowers were used in these massive bouquets, 9,700 of which were roses.<br
      />&bull;Jungle Garden - The Jungle Garden features a high forest canopy,
      an understory of trees and shrubs, climbing vines, and leaves of giant
      proportions. Plants commonly associated with the tropics grow here,
      including orchids, bromeliads, gingers, ferns, palms, bamboos, and even a
      waterfall.</p>

      <h2>Tips:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;Bring mosquito repellent, there are many
      around there.</p><p>&bull;They have lockers near the entrance if you need
      to store heavy items.</p><p>&bull;Wear comfy shoes. I wore platforms and
      my feet hurt so badly.</p><p>&bull;Do not remove plants, flowers, or fruit
      from the grounds</p><p>&bull;Do not feed the wildlife</p><p>&bull;No
      picnicking is allowed in the gardens</p><p>&bull;Drones are not
      allowed.</p>

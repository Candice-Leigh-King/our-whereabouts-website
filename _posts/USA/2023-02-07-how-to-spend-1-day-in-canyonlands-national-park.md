  title: How to Spend 1 day in Canyonlands National Park
  description: >-
    Canyonlands is known for its unique and diverse landscape, which includes
    towering mesas, deep canyons, and vast deserts. The park covers over 337,000
    acres and is divided into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the
    Needles, the Maze, and the rivers, each with its own unique geologic
    features and recreational opportunities. Visitors to Canyonlands National
    Park can enjoy activities such as hiking, camping, scenic drives, mountain
    biking, and river running.


    I came with low expectations for Canyonlands and fell in love! It has to be
    one of the most underrated parks we've been to in Utah and I hope that you
    add it to your bucket list. The Colorado River and Green River both go
    through Canyonlands and create the canyons the park takes its name from.

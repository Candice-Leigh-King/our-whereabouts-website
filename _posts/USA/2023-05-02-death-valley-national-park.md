This will take about 15 minutes.</p><p><strong>• Artists Palette:&nbsp;</strong>A must-see while visiting Death Valley! The rocks are so colorful, these colors are from volcanic deposits rich in compounds such as iron oxides and chloride, which creates a rainbow effect, hence its name, Rainbow hill.

      Canyoneering tour</strong> with All Ways Adventure. We had a great time
      exploring the slot canyon all to ourselves. The tour was private and the
      area is restricted so we were literally by ourselves which we enjoyed
      since Zion is such a popular national park. If you're looking for an
      experience you'll never forget, book a tour with All Ways
      Adventure.</p><p>• Drive the <strong>Zion-Mount Carmel Highway</strong>
      and admire the beauty. This scenic route is 9.9 miles long and is filled
      with spots where you can stop along the way and take photos.</p><p>• Stop

      <h2>Tickets:</h2><p>1-Day Magic Kingdom Park: 218$ (777 NIS) for both of
      us.</p><p>We always prefer to go on a weekday since the weekends and
      holidays get so crazy, and enjoying that way is hard. We also tend to buy
      the tickets on the official pages that way, you don't have to wait in
      lines in the morning and convert the tickets you have to Disney
      tickets.</p><h2>Opening hours:</h2><p>Check the hours on the Disney site
      because they change, but you should know something about all Disney parks
      - They open the area of downtown Disney until the castle half an hour
      before written on the official site!!! So if the site says the park opens
      at 10 am, it's best to get there at around 9-9:15, so you could enjoy,
      take some photos and get in line for the opening at 9:30! Everyone gets in
      line so they can rope drop to their favorite rides, such as Peter Pan
      (which could reach up to 100 min wait), space mountain, or meet Mickey
      Mouse. Don't forget to take a map of the park! The map has the hours If
      you don't feel like running to the rides, take advantage of the empty
      castle and take some beautiful photos.</p><h2>Fast Pass (Free of
      charge):&nbsp;</h2><p>If you are staying in a Disney hotel, you can book
      three fast passes 60 days before your trip. If you are staying off-site,
      you can book fast passes 30 days before!</p><p><strong>The most popular
      rides in Magic Kingdom are:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&bull;Seven dwarfs mine
      train.<br />&bull;Peter Pan.<br />&bull;The mountains: Space Mountain,
      Thunder Mountain, and Splash mountain.<br />&bull;Haunted mansion.<br
      />&bull;Pirates of the Caribbeans. All these rides have a very long wait
      line in the park. We got a fast pass for Seven dwarfs, Peter Pan and Space
      Mountain.</p><p><strong>The most popular rides in Animal Kingdom
      are:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&bull;Avatar Flight of Passage (Could be a
      90-minute wait)<br />&bull;Na&rsquo;vi River Journey<br
      />&bull;Kilimanjaro Safaris (Important to go in the Daytime so you can see
      the animals)<br />&bull;Expedition Everest</p><p><strong>The most popular
      rides in Disney's Hollywood Studios
      are:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&bull;Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run (Could be
      an 85-minute wait)<br />&bull;Star Tours: The Adventures Continue<br
      />&bull;Slinky Dog Dash (Could be a 90-minute wait)<br />&bull;Toy Story
      Mania (Could be a 60-minute wait)<br />&bull;The Twilight Zone Tower of
      Terror (Could be an 80-minute wait)<br />&bull;Rock 'n' Roller Coaster
      Starring Aerosmith (Could be a 50-minute wait)</p><p><strong>The most
      popular rides in Epcot are:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&bull;Frozen Ever After
      (Could be a 90-minute wait)<br />&bull;Soarin&rsquo; Around the World<br
      />&bull;Test Track</p><h2>Disney Hotel:&nbsp;</h2><p>When purchasing a
      night, it includes:</p><p>&bull;<strong>Admission ticket to the
      park</strong><br />&bull;<strong>Transportation -</strong> Walt Disney
      World maintains a vast transportation network connecting hotels, parks,
      and other attractions via buses, boats, and monorails. All of these
      transportation options are free for Disney Resort guests.<br
      />&bull;<strong>Extra Magic Hours -</strong> Guests staying at a Disney
      Resort property have access to one park each day, either before or after
      regular operating hours, through Extra Magic Hours. Disney World publishes
      a schedule showing which parks open early or late each day. You&rsquo;ll
      need to get to the park at least 30 minutes before morning Extra Magic
      Hours to get the most out of it, so it&rsquo;s best for early risers.
      Evening Extra Magic Hours can make for a late night, better for families
      with older kids.<br />&bull;<strong>FastPass+ reservations 60 days in
      advance - </strong>Three of which are included with every daily park
      ticket let visitors ride the most popular attractions without waiting in
      line.<br />&bull;<strong>Airport -</strong> Those who stay at hotels get
      excellent care to streamline the travel process. To start, they send
      luggage tags to you that let Disney bring your luggage straight to the
      hotel when you land at Orlando Airport. No need to stop at the baggage
      claim. Disney World also operates a free Magical Express Bus service
      between Orlando Airport and Disney World Resorts.<br
      />&bull;<strong>Dinner Reservations -</strong> Walt Disney World
      restaurant reservations are available 180 days before your visit. In some
      cases (think Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table and &lsquo;Ohana at dinner),
      you need to book as far as possible to get your ideal dinner time.<br
      />&bull;<strong>Magic Bands -</strong> Disney World Resort guests are
      entitled to a complimentary new Magic Band for every stay. You can even
      select the color and have them customized with your name. Magic Bands can
      be used to access the parks and FastPass lines, pay for items around the
      parks, and to open your Disney hotel door.<br
      />&bull;​​​​​​​<strong>Disney purchases Delivery -</strong><strong>
      </strong>Purchases in the park could be delivered to your room.</p><h2>How
      to plan for Disney:</h2><p>Disney parks are costly, and so are the things
      inside them.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Minnie Ears:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone loves
      to wear Minnie ears, even adults. Disney keeps coming out with new cool
      ears, but they are always around 25$ (Now it's 29.99$), which is pretty
      expensive. I would advise buying Minnie ears online for cheaper and
      bringing them to the park or the Disney store outlet. (I once found Minnie
      ears for 5.99$!!)</p><p>&bull;<strong> T-Shirts: </strong>The T-shirts in
      Disney run between 30$-55$ - Go to a Disney store outlet before your
      Disney trip, and you can find t-shirts for 10$!!</p><p>&bull; <strong>Her
      Universe: </strong>Great place to get a pretty but cheap princess dress<a

      <h2><strong>Time to travel to Disneyworld:</strong></h2><p>When choosing a
      time to go, best not to go when Americans have vacation since the crowds
      are unbearable. Dan and I looked at the crowd calendar and found the
      perfect timing (the first week of September). It was right after Labor day
      weekend and the first week of school in Florida, so the longest we waited
      for a ride was 30 mins!!!!! we were able to do all the rides + a few that
      we did twice. I recommend this crowd calendar:<a
      href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.undercovertourist.com%2Forlando%2Fcrowd-calendar%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1rnIT_2V8a-jzVC6qrIbNNP_YHoX9EC326wrSNSeH8JW81W_a5RwVHsng&amp;h=AT3jJEJ5FEsZjmDArKI0ZiCmYG9RQ00tLMXOk4nGGs45sYH2y9FdTodULha6mvznd-v_PUipW77WVKKkbLG9651m8Sm21Ko-xHke3MGj2fxOl3KLJLUQPz_IFQolNPzUm_NOPLrHq8MpeE1CVks7HnkThT4UnPY22Fwm-83unkSyY1Jr0GrLNYFRqSqMjLErr1XpqhwNkDsexst2hMhS0bCSUsG5Cf7cQ9zfO1br-bMfWD3HcHE9V9QnZjI6cAR27dT0a0_Pk9ovngZqWWLYmHa7xeFHUaw8JWVtdt0udAOANmk9emKaYe9ws35baT-m8VtJqQPrfbUJUUE9SBrBOIKvoVBOV0RWqGutFKKq3RIryl25BFnJm0pMOEsBDRhN004PnWW2esuN5hdEEviU0cgETiRqdDxGvE9rLX52jzvwyUyB7q7WILk4nFR0zqbXunK5JocaVsFEqzQlgiKN5LozZ6xRrIr_1hkrAM67JPfrAVnNmY9ZtHWlvVMGZL3CmhdaKc-VZ6XtOGIYDrDEJfgBDEYnZ-1oQRiKxeAMw3StrZcsYeV3Bt6ntMUWX21FiNAzuY6-CIjokrpunpHSkoPrBHn8JumLTshOhMmNFh3sphCjLps9yVX-D_q8zWrJFB4cTZMC_9GNCcQ">
      www.undercovertourist.com/orlando/crowd-calendar/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Disney
      Events:&nbsp;</h2><p>Make sure you check what events are happening at
      Disney when you are planning to go. Sometimes Disney has special events
      with separate tickets, and you will have to leave the park earlier that
      day.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Halloween -</strong> From the middle of September
      until October 31st, they have a Halloween party twice/three times a
      week.<br />&bull;<strong>Christmas -</strong> From November until
      December, they have the Christmas party.<br />&bull;<strong>Disney
      Marathon</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Memory Maker:</h2><p>If you stay in
      the park for a few days, you might want to think about purchasing a memory
      maker, which is 169$ for unlimited photos of you. around the park, there
      are many, many photographers. They have around the castles, meeting
      characters, in the attractions. You can get all the photos that way. You
      also have an option to purchase individual images, but it is about 17$ per
      photo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Disneyworld App:</h2><p>I recommend you
      download the app! 1. you have a park map. 2. you can see the time wait for
      the rides. 3. you can make reminders for the shows. 4. is a reason not
      many know- but when you get hungry and want to eat, it tends to get pretty
      crowded in the lines to order food. instead of waiting in line, you can
      order on the app, and your phone buzzes when the food is
      ready.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Buttons:</h2><p>At City hall (on your left when
      you enter the park), you could get different pins for occasions you
      celebrate the park, such as birthdays and anniversaries. These pins don't
      usually give you anything. Still, people around the park will congratulate
      you, and for my birthday, I got a free coffee and Cinnabon from Starbucks
      in the park from a worker called Miriam! Thanks, Miriam you made my
      day!!!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Disabilities:</h2><p>If you have a Chronic
      disease/disability, you need to bring a note from your Doctor (GP) that
      states your name and disability in English. You will get a form to give
      the workers for each ride; they give you an hour to return, and then you
      ride without waiting. For more info,<a
      href="https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/faq/guests-with-disabilities/?fbclid=IwAR2Rp7_ohZNH_S1l1LvFpp0zTFIwQJH-e8fjib86XSoPFDddMt8qRPGP0d4">
      click here!</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Best spots for the
      shows:</h2><p>&bull; <strong>For the daytime parade:</strong><br />Go
      about an hour before the parade and sit right across from the castle it
      kind of adds to the parade seeing the castle behind the charters.<br
      />&bull; <strong>For the lights show at night:</strong><br />Go an hour+
      before because this seems to get SUPER crowded no matter when you go. the
      best place is behind the Mickey mouse and Walt Disneys Statue!!!!</p>

      <h2>When to visit:</h2><p>The best time to visit is spring and fall
      (Apr-May &amp; Sep-Oct). The temperature is good and it isn't as crowded
      as in summertime (Jun-Aug). The best way to beat the crowds is if you
      visit in the winter (Nov-Mar): This is the best time for those who want to
      beat the crowds, and the prices of The View are lower. It'll be cold so be
      sure to wear suitable clothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How long to
      stay:</h2><p>You can easily spend half a day here. If you've got time I'd
      suggest spending at least 1 night in the area to better
      explore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to stay:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;The View
      Hotel<br />&bull;Goulding's Lodge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to
      eat:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;Goulding's Stagecoach Dining Room.<br
      />&bull;Linda&rsquo;s Red Trailer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What to
      do:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;Navajo Tribal Scenic drive.<br />&bull;Forrest Gump
      Point.<br />&bull;Mexican Hat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Pets:</h2><p>Pets must
      be leashed and all hikers must remain on the designated
      path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Drones:&nbsp;</h2><p>Not allowed.</p>

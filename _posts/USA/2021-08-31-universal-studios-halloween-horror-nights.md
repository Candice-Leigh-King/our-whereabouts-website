  title: 'Universal Studios: Halloween Horror nights'
  description: >
    Unlike Mickey's not-so-scary Halloween party in Disneyland, the Halloween
    party in Universal Studios is terrifying. It is not made for kids or even
    teens who get scared easily. They turn the place into a scare zone. They
    create mazes that you walk through with props and actual people who jump out
    and scare you. The things you see in the maze might be disturbing to some
    but for those who are major horror and thriller lovers, just like me, you'll
    enjoy this so much!

    In this blog post, I talk about Dates, Tickets prices, event rules, VIP
    tickets, time, and routes.

      <h2><strong>Dates:</strong></h2><p><strong>September 8th-October 31st.<br
      />Every Thursday-Sunday.</strong></p><p>Halloween Horror nights are pretty
      popular. The closer you get to Halloween, the more significant the crowds
      are. We decided to go on Halloween&nbsp; because we heard theories that
      Halloween night itself isn't so crowded. We were able to finish all the
      mazes + rides that were open in 7 hours and still had 1 hour free. Someone
      I know was at the party a week before and couldn't ride any of the rides
      and missed 2 mazes because she had no
      time.</p><h2><strong>Price:</strong></h2><p>Tickets start at 72$ and can
      reach up to 102$ during the last 2 weekends before Halloween.<br
      />Halloween Horror Nights require an event ticket. You must buy them
      online before the tickets run out! The parks remain operational during the
      day and transition to Halloween Horror Nights at night so if you don't
      have a ticket for the event, you will be escorted out of the park at 7
      pm.<br />Ticket prices greatly vary between dates; Sundays, Wednesdays,
      and Thursdays during the beginning of the event are the least expensive
      while Saturdays and Fridays closer to Halloween are the most costly.<br

      Tickets:</strong></h2><ul><li>Halloween Horror Nights Express Pass allows
      guests to bypass standby lines and dramatically reduce their waits. This
      is the front of the line but only once for each maze. Tickets range
      between 159-249$ if you've got the money I recommend this.</li><li>Express
      pass Unlimited - It's unlimited front line tickets and it ranges between
      189-299$</li><li>VIP tour - Special guided tour of mazes and Universal
      backlot with VIP trolley transportation. Buffet dinner, drinks, and
      desserts. Exclusive lower lot lounge area with interactive themed photo
      ops, drinks, and desserts. Unlimited access to mazes and rides. Valet
      parking.</li><li>After 2 PM day/night - Daytime admission to the theme
      park after 2 PM and entrance to the Halloween horror night, beware- it's
      only valid on select dates.<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Event
      hours:</strong></h2><p><strong>5 pm to 2 am</strong></p><p>Tickets say
      event starts at 7pm BUT <em><strong>the park opens for the Halloween
      Horror night at 5pm</strong>!!!!</em>&nbsp; Arrive at 4:45, get in line so
      you can be first in the park and get to the mazes before everyone. Don't
      forget to grab a map on your way in.</p>

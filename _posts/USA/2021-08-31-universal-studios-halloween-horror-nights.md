  title: 'Universal Studios: Halloween Horror nights'
  description: >
    Unlike Mickey's not-so-scary Halloween party in Disneyland, the Halloween
    party in Universal Studios is terrifying. It is not made for kids or even
    teens who get scared easily. They turn the place into a scare zone. They
    create mazes that you walk through with props and actual people who jump out
    and scare you. The things you see in the maze might be disturbing to some
    but for those who are major horror and thriller lovers, just like me, you'll
    enjoy this so much!

    In this blog post, I talk about Dates, Tickets prices, event rules, VIP
    tickets, time, and routes.

      <h2><strong>Dates:</strong></h2><p><strong>September 8th-October 31st.<br
      />Every Thursday-Sunday.</strong></p><p>Halloween Horror nights are pretty
      popular. The closer you get to Halloween, the more significant the crowds
      are. We decided to go on Halloween&nbsp; because we heard theories that
      Halloween night itself isn't so crowded. We were able to finish all the
      mazes + rides that were open in 7 hours and still had 1 hour free. Someone
      I know was at the party a week before and couldn't ride any of the rides
      and missed 2 mazes because she had no
      time.</p><h2><strong>Price:</strong></h2><p>Tickets start at 72$ and can
      reach up to 102$ during the last 2 weekends before Halloween.<br
      />Halloween Horror Nights require an event ticket. You must buy them
      online before the tickets run out! The parks remain operational during the
      day and transition to Halloween Horror Nights at night so if you don't
      have a ticket for the event, you will be escorted out of the park at 7
      pm.<br />Ticket prices greatly vary between dates; Sundays, Wednesdays,
      and Thursdays during the beginning of the event are the least expensive
      while Saturdays and Fridays closer to Halloween are the most costly.<br
      />To order tickets<a

      Tickets:</strong></h2><ul><li>Halloween Horror Nights Express Pass allows
      guests to bypass standby lines and dramatically reduce their waits. This
      is the front of the line but only once for each maze. Tickets range
      between 159-249$ if you've got the money I recommend this.</li><li>Express
      pass Unlimited - It's unlimited front line tickets and it ranges between
      189-299$</li><li>VIP tour - Special guided tour of mazes and Universal
      backlot with VIP trolley transportation. Buffet dinner, drinks, and
      desserts. Exclusive lower lot lounge area with interactive themed photo
      ops, drinks, and desserts. Unlimited access to mazes and rides. Valet
      parking.</li><li>After 2 PM day/night - Daytime admission to the theme
      park after 2 PM and entrance to the Halloween horror night, beware- it's
      only valid on select dates.<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Event
      hours:</strong></h2><p><strong>5 pm to 2 am</strong></p><p>Tickets say
      event starts at 7pm BUT <em><strong>the park opens for the Halloween
      Horror night at 5pm</strong>!!!!</em>&nbsp; Arrive at 4:45, get in line so
      you can be first in the park and get to the mazes before everyone. Don't
      forget to grab a map on your way in.</p>

      <h2>OUR ROUTE:&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to start the night is to go to
      the lower lot. since most people go to the mazes in order from the
      entrance to the bottom, it makes more sense to go to the bottom first and
      make your way up. The mazes change throughout the years and so does the
      theme but there are some mazes that stay for a while. If you've been to
      Universal Studios before, do know that the rides that are open during
      Halloween Horror Nights have no scary effects added to them and are just
      the regular rides that we know and love.</p><h2>1. Lower lot:</h2><p>We
      started off with the stranger things maze since it was very popular. After
      that, we went all the way to the mazes in the movie set area which was
      really cool over there you've got Ghostbusters, Frankenstein, a creep
      show, and a scare zone.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Stranger Things
      (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time: </strong>15-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We love stranger Things, so we enjoyed
      this.<br /><strong>Update 2021:</strong> This maze was the
      Exorcist.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Ghostbusters (maze)</strong><br
      /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 5 minutes wait.<br /><strong>Score:</strong>
      ⭐️⭐️ This was a cute maze, but compared to the others it wasn't my
      favorite.<br /><strong>Update 2021: </strong>The
      purge.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Frankenstein (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> 15 minutes wait.<br /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️ It Was
      fun!<br /><strong>Update 2021: </strong>The
      purge.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Creep Show (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> None, we just walked in<br /><strong>Score:
      </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ AMAZING!!!</p><p>&bull;<strong>All Hallows Evil Scare
      Zone (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 5-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ So scary and
      AWESOME!</p><p>&bull;<strong>Killer Klowns from outer space
      (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 20-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ It was great!<br /><strong>Update
      2021:</strong> Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Jurassic World
      (ride)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time: </strong>None, we just walked in.
      No, wait. It was a chilly night, so we decided to sit in the back so we
      wouldn't get wet.<br /><strong>Score: </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ They changed the
      ride from Jurassic park to Jurassic world, and we loved it. You get wetter
      on this ride than before so do consider that while riding at
      night</p><p>&bull;<strong>The Mummy (ride)</strong><br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> We walked in, but since there weren't so many people, we
      waited a minute more so we could sit front row.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A classic and epic
      ride.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Transformers (ride)</strong><br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> 5-minute wait since we asked for the front row.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We always enjoy this
      ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Upper
      lot:</h2><p>&bull;<strong>Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey
      (ride)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time: </strong>20-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐⭐️⭐️⭐️ We rode it twice in a row because the
      ride broke down for 2 minutes in the middle.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Us
      (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 50-minute wait!!!<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> It wasn't as great as I thought it would be.
      ⭐️⭐️⭐️<br /><strong>Update 2021: </strong>Haunting Hill
      house.</p><p>&bull;<strong>The curse of Pandora's box (maze)<br
      />W</strong><strong>ait time: </strong>35 minutes wait.<br
      /><strong>Score: </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This was our FAVOURITE!<br
      /><strong>Update 2021:</strong> They had this
      maze.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Harry Potter Dark Arts (show) - </strong>Night
      light show on the castle. Don't miss it.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Holidayz in
      Hell (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 5-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️<br /><strong>Update 2021:</strong>
      Halloween - Michael Mayers.</p><p>&bull;<strong>The Walking Dead
      (ride)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time: </strong>5-minute wait.<br
      /><strong>Score: </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️</p><p>&bull;<strong>House of 1,000
      corpses (maze)</strong><br /><strong>Wait time:</strong> 5-minute wait<br
      /><strong>Score: </strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We loved it!<br /><strong>Update
      2021:</strong> Bride of Frankenstein lives.</p><p><em>It was already 1:00
      AM and we were done with all the mazes and rides the park has to offer
      during Halloween night beside the Simpson ride.</em></p><p><strong>The
      Simpsons (ride)</strong><strong> -</strong> At 1:00 it had a 50-minute
      wait that we just didn't think it was worth it since we have ridden that
      ride a million times before.</p><p><strong>Jabbawockeez Show
      (show)</strong><strong> - </strong>We didn't watch this since we heard it
      isn't so great.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you see that it's a crowded
      night, DO NOT go on the rides (the walking dead, the mummy, Transformers,
      Harry Potter, and the Simpsons) <em>Since they don't change the ride for
      Halloween,</em> you can ride them on a regular day. The mazes, however,
      are there only on Halloween night.</strong></p>

  title: Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada
  description: >-
    Did you know that the Valley of Fire is Nevada’s oldest and largest state
    park? 

    It's filled with red rock formations made from Aztec sandstone and contains
    ancient, petrified trees and petroglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years.
    The stunning red sandstone rock formations illuminate the valley, especially
    at sunset, making it look appear as though it’s on fire.

      <h2>When to visit:</h2><p>The best time to visit the Valley of Fire is
      November to March when the temperatures are cool and the days are longer.
      If you must visit outside these months it can be very hot and most hikes
      have no shade, which can make even the short hikes unbearable.</p><h2>Best
      time of the day to visit:&nbsp;</h2><p>Arrive as early as possible or
      late, sunrises and sunsets are remarkable here and you'll avoid the crowds
      and the heat.</p><h2>How long to stay:&nbsp;</h2><p>If you're planning on
      driving through and stopping at scenic viewpoints and doing a short trail
      you can stay as little as 2 hours, but if you want to really enjoy
      everything VoF has to offer you'll want to spend a full
      day.</p><h2>Pets:</h2><p>Pets are welcome, but they must be kept on a
      leash of not more than six feet in length.</p><h2>Drones:&nbsp;</h2><p>The
      use of drones or any remote-controlled aircraft is not allowed.</p>

      <h2><strong>7. Hike Delicate Arch at sunset, Utah</strong></h2><p>Arches
      National Park is home to many beautiful Arches. Delicate Arch is the crown
      jewel in Arches National Park and the sunsets here make the arch glow.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Length: </strong>3.1 miles (5.1 km)<br
      /><strong>&bull;Elevation gain: </strong>629 feet (192 m)<br
      /><strong>&bull;Difficulty:</strong>
      Moderate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>8. Explore Goblin Valley State Park,
      Utah</strong></h2><p>Goblin Valley State Park is such a fun place to
      explore. It's located in southeastern Utah. With its hoodoos, toadstools
      that look like goblins, and short hiking
      trails.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>9. Explore off-road in Hanksville,
      Utah</strong></h2><p>There are so many hidden gems in Utah that can be
      found when exploring off-road.</p><p>&bull; Long Dong Silver.<br />&bull;

      Center.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>10. Hike the Navajo Loop at sunrise in
      Bryce Canyon, Utah</strong></h2><p>Navajo Loop Trail is one of the most
      beautiful hikes in Bryce Canyon. It connects to Queens Garden which is
      definitely worth checking out too so you can start the hike from either
      Sunset Point (Navajo Loop Trail) or from Sunrise Point (Queens Garden
      Trail).<br /><strong>&bull;Best time to hike: </strong>Sunrises are
      incredible here and less crowded.<br /><strong>&bull;Best wat to hike:
      </strong>Both involve a steep elevation, but if you'd like to get that
      cool Instagram photo of the hairpin paths better start with Navajo Loop
      Trail.<br /><strong>&bull;Length: </strong>2.9 miles.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Difficulty: </strong>Moderate.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Elevation Gain:</strong> 600 feet.<br

      Narrows at Zion National Park, Utah</strong></h2><p>The Narrows is one of
      the most popular hikes in Zion NP and is a must! The Narrows is 18 miles
      long but the beauty of the hike is that you can go as far as you like and
      turn back when you're ready. It is best to go in at least 3 miles up to
      Wall Street.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>12. See Zion National Park from
      the air&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Drones aren't allowed in National Parks so
      what better way to see Zion than from above? Besides the thrill of being
      on a helicopter ride, you'll see incredible views.&nbsp;<br

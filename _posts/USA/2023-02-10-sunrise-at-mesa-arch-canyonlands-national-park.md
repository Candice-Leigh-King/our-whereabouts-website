  title: Sunrise at Mesa Arch, Canyonlands National Park
  description: >-
    Canyonlands is known for its unique and diverse landscape, which includes
    towering mesas, deep canyons, and vast deserts. The park covers over 337,000
    acres and is divided into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the
    Needles, the Maze, and the rivers, each with its own unique geologic
    features and recreational opportunities. Visitors to Canyonlands National
    Park can enjoy activities such as hiking, camping, scenic drives, mountain
    biking, and river running.


    Catching the sunrise at Mesa Arch is something everyone on a southwest road
    trip should add to their bucketlist. The early morning light makes the arch
    and the canyon behind glow as if it's on fire & is mesmerizing to see.

    textarea_html: "<h2>Best time to visit:</h2><p>The best time of day to visit Mesa Arch is at sunrise! You’ll want to arrive 30-45 mins before sunrise to give you time to hike to the arch &amp; get a good spot with the view because it will be crowded! If you're coming from Moab, you’ll want to leave around 1.5 hours before sunrise because it's about an hour's drive from Moab to the Mesa Arch parking lot.</p><p>\_</p><h2>Trail Details:</h2><p>•Trailhead: Mesa Arch Trailhead<br />•Distance: 0.7 miles (RT)<br />•Elevation: 88 feet<br />•Difficulty: Easy<br />•Time to Hike: 30 mins<br />•Toilet: at the trailhead<br />•Parking: There is a small parking lot with about 30 spots. If you arrive before sunrise, there shouldn't be an issue.</p><p>\_</p><h2>Tips:</h2><p>•Bring a headlamp for the hike.<br />•Expect crowds: This is a popular activity because it's easily accessible. If you see the photographers with their tripods &amp; can't find a spot near the arch, don't worry there are other beautiful spots around to capture the sunrise over the canyon from a different perspective.<br />•Stay way after sunrise: it's amazing to see how quickly the photographers scatter right after sunrise &amp; the lighting was still perfect for photos.<br />•Photographers code - even though this gets so crowded, there's some kind of understanding between everyone not to push, and get into others' sunrise shot.</p>"

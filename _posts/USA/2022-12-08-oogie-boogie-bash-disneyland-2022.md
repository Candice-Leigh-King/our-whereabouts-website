      <h2><strong>Tickets:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>&bull;It is a special event so
      tickets are sold separately</p><p>&bull;Prices are from
      129-179$</p><p>&bull;Tickets go on sale around July &amp; can run out
      quickly. This year all the events sold out within only 2 days, so make
      sure to order fast</p><p>&bull;Ticket includes admission to Disney
      California Adventure Park, a small bag for trick or treating, and a
      PhotoPass during the event</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Hours:&nbsp;</h2><p>The
      event officially starts at 6 pm, but you can enter the park as early as 3
      pm (People start getting in line as early as 2:30)</p><p>𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠:
      If you're visiting during September/October and don't have tickets for the
      event you will be "kicked out" of California Adventure Park at 6 pm for
      the event</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Costume Rules:</h2><p>The best part of the
      event is seeing everyone's beautiful &amp; creative
      costumes.</p><p>Costumes must be family-friendly, Guests who dress like
      characters may not pose for pictures/sign autographs for others, costumes
      may not contain sharp objects, and Costumes may not reach or drag on the
      ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Trick or Treat:</h2><p>Across the park are
      Treat Trails where you can collect candy and meet villains at the end of
      the trail</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Character Meet &amp; Greets:</h2><p>One of
      the best things at the event is that Mickey and his friends are dressed up
      each year differently and you can meet characters that you don't often see
      in the park like Oogie Boogie, Maleficent, Cruella, Madam Mim, and
      more</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Frightfully Fun Parade:&nbsp;</h2><p>We love this
      parade!</p><p>The best spot to watch the parade is near 'The Little
      mermaid' ride, across from Pixar Pier.</p><p>They have 2 shows, always go
      for the second show because there are way fewer
      people</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Villain's Grove Oogie Boogie
      Bash:</h2><p>Redwood Creek Challenge Trail is transformed into a mystical
      villain-inspired maze. The color, lights, and sound are mesmerizing</p>

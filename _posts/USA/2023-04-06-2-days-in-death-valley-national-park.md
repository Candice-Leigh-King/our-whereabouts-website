      <h2><strong>DAY 1:</strong></h2><h2>•Death Valley Sign:</h2><p>Have you
      even been to a National Park, if you didn't take a photo with the National
      Park Sign?</p><h2>•Golden Canyon Trail:</h2><p>The trail is approximately
      3 miles long and takes hikers through a narrow canyon with towering rock
      formations, colorful rock layers, and stunning views of the surrounding
      desert landscape. This will take about 2 hours.</p><h2>•Devil's Golf
      Course:</h2><p>A unique geological feature. The salt flats of Devil's Golf
      Course were formed by the evaporation of an ancient lake that once filled
      Death Valley. Over time, the salt deposits were shaped by wind and rain,
      creating a landscape of jagged salt formations that resemble a golf
      course. This will take about 15 minutes.</p><h2>•Natural
      Bridge:</h2><p>This hike is approximately 2 miles round-trip and takes you
      through a scenic canyon with towering rock formations and colorful rock
      layers. The trail is not marked, so visitors should bring a map and be
      prepared for some challenging terrain. This will take about 1
      hour.</p><h2>•Badwater Basin:</h2><p>This is the lowest point in North
      America at 282 ft (86 m) below sea level. Death Valley is such an
      underrated National Park and Badwater Basin is a gem!<br />Length: 1.9
      miles RT&nbsp; |&nbsp; Difficulty: Easy |&nbsp; Duration: 46
      minutes.</p><h2>•Artist's Palette:</h2><p>End your day at Artist's
      Palette. A must-see while visiting Death Valley! The rocks are so
      colorful, these colors are from volcanic deposits rich in compounds such
      as iron oxides and chloride, which creates a rainbow effect, hence its
      name, Rainbow hill. It is located off of a one way Scenic loop road, so
      make sure you don't miss the turn off to the parking lot.Legnth: 0.3 miles
      out and back (15 mins)&nbsp; |&nbsp; Difficulty: Easy.</p>

      <h2><strong>DAY 2:</strong></h2><h2>•Sunrise at Zabriskie
      Point:</h2><p>The best spot to watch the sunrise in Death Valley. Come
      early and catch a spot because many photographers come to catch that
      beautiful morning shot. Don't worry, right after sunrise they all leave
      the place pretty quickly. This trail is very easy, you park you car and
      walk 3 minutes.</p><h2>•Dante's View:</h2><p>A great viewpoint over Death
      Valley. You can even see Badwater Basin! Sadly we didn't have a clear
      morning so we couldn't see much. There's a short hiking trail here thats
      Definitely worth hiking.</p><h2>•Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes:</h2><p>A unique
      and surreal landscape of sand dunes surrounded by mountains.Legnth: ~2.8
      miles | Difficulty: Moderate.</p><h2>•Mosaic Canyon:</h2><p>Mosaic Canyon
      is a stunning geological wonder. It is a popular destination for hikers
      and nature enthusiasts due to its unique and visually striking rock
      formations.</p><h2>•Darwin Falls:</h2><p>This is a hidden gem located in
      Death Valley National Park. It is a picturesque oasis nestled within the
      desert landscape, offering a refreshing contrast to the arid
      surroundings.</p>

      <p>As conent creators we get asked what gear we use. I will be updating
      this post every once and a while</p><blockquote><h4>They say: the best
      camera is the one you have with you</h4></blockquote>

      <h2><strong>Camera:</strong></h2><p>Canon M50 Mark II.&nbsp;</p><p>The M50
      is Canon's very first Mirrorless camera and it is a great start for those
      wanting to get quality photos on a budget. We love it also because it is
      lightweight and perfect for traveling.</p><h2><strong>Lenses and Extras
      for Camera:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&bull;<strong>Canon EF-M 15-45mm
      f/3.5-6.3 IS STM&nbsp;</strong><br />This is the lens that comes with the
      Camera. It is simple and great for portrait
      photos.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS
      STM&nbsp;</strong><br />This is our telephoto and it is a game-changer. It
      takes your photos to a whole new level.</p><p>&bull;​​​​<strong>San Disk
      SD Card - 2TB</strong><br />You're going to want to buy this if you're
      shooting RAW images.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Canon LP-E12
      Batteries</strong><br />We have 4 of these because we found that the
      batteries can last somewhere between 1-4hours. If you're out for a full
      day and love to take photos as much as we do, You're going to want at
      least 3 batteries.</p>

      <h2><strong>Drone:</strong></h2><p>We just purchased our first drone
      <strong>DJI Mini 3 Pro.</strong></p><p>We are still learning how to use it
      but it's perfect for content creators since it's got an option to take
      content vertically and it is lightweight.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><b>Tripod</b></h2><p><strong>Peak Design Carbon Fiber Travel
      Tripod</strong></p><p>We just invested in a new tripod and this tripod has
      everything you need. It's on the pricy side, but it made our lives so much
      easier. It is specially made for travelers and it is very
      sturdy.</p><h2><b>Our old tripod:</b></h2><p><strong>UBeesize
      TR50</strong></p><p>This has been a really great tripod for beginners. It
      is affordable, lightweights and comes with a remote for your phone.</p>

      <h2><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon);
      font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;"><b>Go
      Pro</b></span></h2><p><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color:
      var(--color-carbon); font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing:
      0.01rem;">We have always owned a Go Pro since we are adventure and water
      lovers. Right now we own a Go Pro Hero 6 and we&nbsp;</span>love
      it.</p><h4><br /><br />Accessories:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li><p>El Grande Selfie
      Stick</p></li><li><p>3 batteries</p></li><li><p>Charger</p></li><li><p>San

      <h2><strong>Backpack</strong></h2><p>Lowepro Tahoe BP150 Backpack
      Black</p><p>We love this backpack. It fits all our gear and it is very
      comfortable.</p>

      <h2>OTHERS:</h2><ul><li><strong>Hard drive:</strong><br />WD Element hard
      drive - 5TB<br />Best take a 5TB hard drive especially if you're shooting
      on RAW images. Those take up a lot of
      storage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Portable Chargers:</strong><br />Miracase -
      Power Bank 10,000 mAh - 20W - MPB10PD20W<br />We have 2 of these and it's
      usually just enough for both of us during a day out.</li></ul>

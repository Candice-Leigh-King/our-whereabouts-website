  title: Isla Mujeres Travel Guide
  description: >-
    We spent 22 days in Mexico, 7 of them were in Playa del Carmen. Playa del
    Carmen is a great place to base yourself and go and explore. Once we landed
    in Cancun and took a bus from the airport to Playa del Carmen. It is easy to
    find the ADO buses outside the airport. It is a direct bus to ADO bus
    station near Fifth Avenue in Playa del Carmen. Tickets are typically less
    than $10.

      <p>During our three-week stay in Mexico, we visited Isla Mujeres for three
      nights/2.5 days and enjoyed this island. It's less popular than Cancun
      which means it's quieter and makes for a great spot to relax. But don't
      worry, there are many things to do on this island like scuba diving,
      snorkeling, and exploring the island with a golf cart.&nbsp;</p><p>In this
      post, we cover how to get there, how long to stay, where to stay, things
      to do, where to eat, and our 2.5-day itinerary.</p>

      <h2><strong>HOW TO GET THERE:</strong></h2><p>To get to Isla Mujeres,
      you'll take a ferry from Cancun.</p><h2><strong>HOW LONG TO
      STAY:</strong></h2><p>There are those who go on a day tour from Cancun to
      Isla Mujeres, but I think that this island has so much to offer that you
      can't possibly cover it all on a day tour. I would recommend a minimum of
      2 nights here.</p><h2><strong>WHERE TO STAY:</strong></h2><p>Best to stay
      in the island's northern part, close to Playa Norte.</p><p>We stayed at
      𝐼𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑙 𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ 𝐻𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑙 <em>☆☆☆☆☆</em></p><p>It cost us 109 USD
      per night. We got upgraded to a suite because we were on our honeymoon,
      which was nice and thoughtful. The hotel is pretty great, with big rooms
      and comfortable beds. It&rsquo;s in the BEST location! It is right on the
      top of the main street with all the restaurants and shops. The hotel's
      beach is Playa Norte which is the most famous beach in Isla Mujeres;
      it&rsquo;s so beautiful and has got amazing sunsets.</p>

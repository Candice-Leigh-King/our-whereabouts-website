  title: How to spend 7 Days in Playa del Carmen
  description: >-
    We spent 22 days in Mexico, 7 of them were in Playa del Carmen. Playa del
    Carmen is a great place to base yourself and go and explore. Once we landed
    in Cancun and took a bus from the airport to Playa del Carmen. It is easy to
    find the ADO buses outside the airport. It is a direct bus to ADO bus
    station near Fifth Avenue in Playa del Carmen. Tickets are typically less
    than $10.

      <p>This was my first trip to Mexico and what can I say? I fell in love!
      Mexico is rich with diversity and culture, it has got it all! Which makes
      it such a great destination for any type of traveler.<br />From Mayan
      ruins and lush jungles to pristine Pacific Coast, no matter how many times
      you'll visit Mexico will keep you wanting to see more.<br />This was Dans
      3rd visit to Mexico and we explored areas he's never been to
      before.</p><p>We spent 22 days in Mexico, 7 of them were in Playa del

      <h2><strong>DAY 1 - RELAX AT HOTEL POOL &amp; EXPLORE 5TH
      AVENUE:</strong></h2><p>We based ourselves in a hotel called <a
      href="https://ourwhereabouts.com/accommodation/2021/05/12/magic-blue-spa-boutique-hotel-playa-del-carmen.html">'Magic
      blue hotel'</a> not too far from the famous 5th Avenue. 5th Avenue is the
      main street in Playa del Carmen that is filled with all the stores,
      restaurants, and bars. If you are staying in the center of Playa Del
      Carmen then you are surely going to walk around here to
      explore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 2 - CHICHEN ITZA, CENOTE IK KIL
      &amp; VALLADOLID:</strong></h2><p>We took a day trip from Playa del Carmen
      to the Chichen Itza which included also the Ik Kil Cenote and
      Valladolid.</p><h2>Chichen Itza:</h2><p>It is one of the new seven world
      wonders of the world. It is no surprise that it is Mexico's top
      attraction. It's believed to be the former Mayan city that dates back to
      as early as 550 AD.</p><p><br />You could rent a car and drive there -
      this isn't the option we took but it is the best one since we always
      prefer to go on our own. There is enough parking around the area for free.
      If you'd like to pay for parking in order not to have any damage on your
      rental, you can park right on site, which costs only 2$.</p><p>We took a
      tour with Sayvin M&eacute;xico tour since we had really bad weather in
      Playa del Carmen and didn't want to drive in the rain. The tour is from
      the 8:00 until 18:00 and it inculdes Chichen Itza, Cenote Ik Kil and
      Valladolid.<br />&bull;<strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>232 Pesos per adult
      (about 13 USD). Bring cash because they do not accept credit cards.<br
      />&bull;<strong>The best time to visit:</strong> Best to go early in the
      morning when the gates open, or after 3 p.m. when sunlight bathes the
      pyramid&rsquo;s main staircase and the crowds usually start to clear out.
      It typically takes about two to three hours to tour the complex. What to
      wear: Make sure to bring comfortable shoes, the path is rocky, the complex
      is huge and there is so much to see. Also do know that there isn't much
      shade here so wear sunscreen and hydrate.</p><h2>Cenote Ik
      Kil:</h2><p>What is a cenote? a cenote is a natural pit/sinkhole,
      resulting from the collapse that exposes groundwater underneath. The
      cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings.
      Cenote Ik Kil was our favorite Cenote that we've been to, but do know that
      there are those that usually get disappointed by it because it gets
      <em><strong>very crowded.</strong></em> You're unlikely to get photographs
      without lots of people in them unless you come very early. From Ik Kil
      Cenote we headed towards Valladolid but we had really bad
      weather.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 3 - GRAND CENOTE &amp;
      COBA:</strong></h2><p>️We took a tour that included Grand cenote and Coba.
      Coba is an ancient Mayan city. One of Coba's main attractions is the
      Ancient Pyramid which, unlike Chichen Itza's Pyramid, is still open for
      the public to climb its 130 steps up to the top of the site. Nohoch Mul is
      also known as the Great Pyramid. It reaches a height of 42m, making it the
      second-tallest Maya structure on the Yucat&aacute;n.</p><p>Climbing the
      old steps can be scary for some since the steps are steep. There is a rope
      in the middle to help you hold us as you climb up but since I am 1.5m'
      short, I kind of crawled up the pyramid and it was well worth it because
      when you reach the top, the view is breathtaking. Try to arrive early
      because it gets really hot and really busy in the
      afternoon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 4 - TULUM:</strong></h2><p>We
      rented a car and drove to Tulum to see the Mayan Ruins and relax at
      Parasio beach.</p><h2>Tulum Mayan Ruins:&nbsp;</h2><p><br />Tulum ruins
      are located 60km south of Playa del Carmen and is considered the most
      beautiful of the Mayan Ruins sites in the area. It is small but beautiful.
      Situated on the fifteen-meter-high cliffs, it gives you a gorgeous view of
      the beautiful blue and turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea.<br />In
      Maya, Tulum means "Wall", and the city was christened thus because it is a
      walled city; one of the very few the ancients ever built. Research
      suggests it was formerly called Zama or "to dawn" in its day, which is
      appropriate given the location.</p><h2>Parasio Beach:</h2><p>Parasio beach
      is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in Tulum. We really
      enjoyed it but sadly the year we visited had a really bad case of
      seaweed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 5 - CENOTE EDEN, CENOTE AZUL
      &amp; AKUMAL BEACH:</strong></h2><p>On the second day with the car, we
      drove to the Cenotes first and then to Akumal. We saved money by buying
      our own snorkels as appose to renting ones every time we go to Cenote or
      the beach. Cenote Azul was way prettier in my opinion. DO NOT go on
      Saturdays or Sundays, the Mexicans also enjoy the cenote and it will get
      massively packed. Akumal is a beach known to have a lot of sea turtles.
      Besides having these amazing creatures everywhere, the beach happens to be
      really really beautiful. I would spend more time at this beach and give up
      on Paraiso beach in Tulum. We were in the water for about an hour and saw
      about 5-6 turtles it was so amazing, GO! GO! GO!</p><h2>Akumal
      Beach:&nbsp;</h2><p>This was probably our favorite beach in the
      Tulum/Playa del Carmen area! Snorkeling with the sea turtles at Playa
      Akumal was a highlight of our trip. We opted to hire a local guide on the
      beach after we paid the entrance fee. There are agents there that will
      tell you that you need to book a tour with them in order to see the
      turtles, but that is not true. We brought our snorkel gear and saw about 9
      sea turtles!! They have free <strong><em>locker</em>s</strong> to use with
      a 5 USD deposit.</p><p><strong>Please DO NOT chase or disturb these
      beautiful creatures; just watch.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY
      6 - SHOPPING, CASINO, AND MOVIE:</strong></h2><h2>Plaza Las Americas
      Mall:</h2><p>If you are looking for a local mall and not a touristy one
      then this is it. By taxi, it is about 10 NIS from our hotel to the mall.
      In the mall, they have a Casino called Winpot and a movie
      theater.</p><h2>The Cinepolis Movie Theater:</h2><p>Cinema chain in Mexico
      that is really great. Huge screens and comfortable seats were clean and
      the Mexicans weren&rsquo;t too noisy even though the hall was full. The
      movie theater is located in the mall. We decided to see a movie since we
      love movies and like to check out movie theaters in other countries. The
      film was 73 MNX (3.6 USD) per person, 2 huge popcorns (1 regular and 1
      caramelized ) and 2 giant sodas were altogether 237.8 MNX (11.9 USD). It
      was too much. We had a lot left over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 7 -
      XCARET:</strong></h2><p>Sadly I was very sick so we missed the Xcaret
      park. But let me explain about them.</p><h2>&bull;Xcaret:</h2><p>This park
      is a mix of Mexican culture and water. We decided to go here and even had
      tickets but I got very sick. They have a cool underground river, wine
      cellar, caves, archaeological sites, scenic tower, night shows &amp;
      activities for kids.</p><h1>Other
      Options:&nbsp;</h1><h2>&bull;Xploar:</h2><p>This Park is mostly extreme
      sports such as zip lining, Rafts, Jeeps, and stalactite river swim - if
      you're a thrill seeker this is for you.</p><h2>&bull;Xel Ha:</h2><p>Most
      people go here it's more like a water natural park. they have a Scenic
      Lighthouse with water slides. River Tour where you float down the river in
      an inner tube, Zip-Lines, Snorkeling, Mayan Cave &ndash; considered a
      sacred place, this is covered cenote, Cliff of Courage &ndash; cliff
      jumping, Cenotes, Jungle trails, Bike rides &amp; Activities for
      children.</p>

      <h2><strong>Where to eat in Playa del
      Carmen:</strong></h2><p>&bull;<strong>Eatitaly -</strong> Great place to
      eat on 5th Avenue. You can actually see them make the pasta on the
      spot.</p><p>&bull;<strong>La Famiglia Pizza -</strong> is another great
      Italian restaurant right next to our hotel.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Tropical
      -</strong> on 5th avenue, this Mexican restaurant/bar is delicious and a
      great Instagram opportunity!!! It is so beautiful and
      unique.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Bovinos Playa del Carmen Restaurant -</strong>
      WOW! It's a Brazilian steakhouse. 96 USD for both of us for unlimited food
      and a pitcher of lemonade. There is a round card at your setting one side
      is green and the other is red. When you are ready to have meat served to
      you, simply turn the card to green. At any time you can go to the buffet
      that is very rich and has everything but red
      meat.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Sushi Ken -</strong> Really great Asian food. We
      loved their noodles, and their fried ice cream was
      delicious!</p><p>&bull;<strong>Po Thai Restaurant -</strong> Another great
      Asian restaurant</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Some helpful information
      about Playa del Carmen:</strong></h2><h2>&bull;ATM: Cibanko</h2><p>That
      was the best and cheapest place to pull out money. Do Not use ATMs. They
      copy your credit card info and then use it!! We came to Mexico with 1,500
      $ and pulled out money only from Cibanko. Take into consideration that
      there isn't a proper bank everywhere in Mexico.<br
      /><strong>Address:</strong> a Via Tendenza Calle 10 entre 14 y 14 bis,
      Local 5, Centro, 77710 Playa del Carmen.</p><h2>&bull;RENTING A CAR:
      Hertz</h2><p>Renting a car is pretty cheap. Most car rentals in Mexico
      make you pay by credit card. We went to Hertz since they were the cheapest
      and they're a worldwide chain, so we felt comfortable letting them use our
      credit card and not worrying about them copying the number.</p><p>Some say
      that driving in Mexico is dangerous because the police there are bribed
      and try to catch you speeding even a tiny bit over the speed limit, so try
      to stay under the speed limit and will ask you to pay in cash for the
      ticket. If you're in that situation, it's very important that you do not
      give your Passport, license, or cash! Demand to go to the police station
      with the cops.</p><p>We weren't scared to rent a car since I'm Colombian
      and Dan is Argentinian, so he speaks fluent Spanish, so it would be harder
      for them to fool us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>SHOPPING: Walmart</h2><p>Near our
      hotel, there were a Walmart, cheap prices good place to buy clothes,
      souvenirs, snorkeling masks &amp; food.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>MEDICAL
      ASSISTANCE: Dr. Bernardo Javier Diaz Avila.</h2><p>Since I mentioned I got
      sick - As a nurse who was worried about getting medical care in a third
      world country, I would love to recommend a doctor that took excellent care
      of me when I was sick and needed an I.V. My insurance paid back full
      amount I spend on this doctor.</p>

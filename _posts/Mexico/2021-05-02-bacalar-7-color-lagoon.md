      <h1>2 Day Itinerary:</h1><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h3><strong>Day
      1:</strong></h3><h2>Sunrise Kayak, Cenote Cocalitos &amp; Cenote
      Azul</h2><p><strong>Sunrise Kayak: </strong>We booked the tour
      with<strong>&nbsp;Kik&aacute;yak</strong> I got to Enrique through a
      friends recommondation. Right away, I knew he was a perfect choice. Most
      people do the sunrise Sap, but I don't think that for beginners, SAP is
      the right choice. Enrique is so outgoing, funny, and an exciting person to
      talk to. He gave us great tips and told us to visit Fort San Felipe, which
      is a place we did not hear about once. We met up at 4 AM our taxi driver
      picked us up at 3:45 am and started to kayak in the dark. It was beautiful
      just us and a million stars in the sky, and then the sunrise was just
      perfect. As we enjoyed the sunrise, we snacked on nuts, pineapples, and
      bananas that Enrique had brought. We highly recommend
      him!</p><p><strong>Cenote Cocalitos &amp; Cenote Azul: </strong><br />The
      most BEAUTIFUL spot in Bacalar!! They have beautiful swings in the water
      and hammocks in the water, good vibes and not many
      people.</p><h2><strong>Day 2:</strong></h2><h2>Fort of San Felipe &amp;
      City center.</h2><p><strong>Fort of San Felipe:&nbsp;</strong>The Fort of
      San Felipe is over 270 years old and provides visitors with a rich view of
      Bacalar's history and the surrounding region. This beautiful stone Fort is
      surrounded by a deep &ldquo;moat&rdquo; and includes canons and ramparts
      and an excellent museum with historical artifacts, murals depicting
      Bacalar&rsquo;s history, and interactive computer exhibits on the Caste
      Wars and pirates and their lives.</p>

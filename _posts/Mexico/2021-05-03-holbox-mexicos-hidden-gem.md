      <p>Holbox is a little piece of heaven for those of you debating whether or
      not to go visit I highly recommend you do.</p><p>During the rainy season
      it is a bit problematic on this island since they do not have cars, only
      mini golfs, and these mini golfs aren't used during the rain since the
      roads over there get way too muddy, and it ruins the mini golf engines on
      top of all that the mosquitoes come out and eat you alive when it rains,
      so it is no fun.</p>

      <h2>HOW TO GET TO HOLBOX:</h2><p>The easiest way to get to Holbox is from
      either Cancun or Playa del Carmen, but you can also get there from Tulum,
      Merida, and Valladolid.<br />The cheapest way to get to Holbox is by
      public bus and a ferry.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Bus:</strong></h4><p>Take an
      ADO bus. Book your trip online because they fill up
      easily.</p><p><strong>From Cancun to Chiquila:</strong><br

      Chiquila takes around three and a half hours.<br
      />&bull;<em><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong></em>around 266 MXN (13.3
      USD).</p><p><strong>From Playa del Carmen to Chiquila:</strong><br
      />&bull;<em><strong>Duration:&nbsp;</strong></em>The bus f​​​​rom Playa
      del Carmen to Chiquila takes around two hours.<br
      />&bull;<strong><em>Cost:</em>&nbsp;</strong>around 276 MXN (13.8

      rental and hop on the Holbox ferry. There are no official parking lots so

      TO STAY:</h2><h3>Holbox Dream Beachfront Hotel</h3><p><br /><strong>Stars:
      </strong>☆☆☆<br /><strong>Price: </strong>Avrage price is 170 USD per
      night.<br /><strong>Duration of stay: </strong>2 nights<br /><strong>Our
      Experience:&nbsp;</strong>We were told that this is a very excellent hotel
      for honeymooners and we were a little disappointed. The rooms weren't so
      clean, it would also get pretty sandy in the room since the rooms are
      surrounded by sand, and there weren't many options for breakfast.<br />If
      that doesn't bother you, know that it is located right near the center,
      has a beautiful beach, and has friendly staff.</p>

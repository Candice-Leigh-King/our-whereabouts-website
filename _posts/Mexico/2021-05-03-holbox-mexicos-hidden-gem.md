  description: >-
    This was my first trip to Mexico and what can I say? I fell in love! Mexico
    is rich with diversity and culture; it has got it all! Which makes it such
    an excellent destination for any type of traveler.


    From Mayan ruins and lush jungles to the pristine Pacific Coast, no matter
    how many times you'll visit Mexico will keep you wanting to see more. One of
    my favorite places in Mexico has to be Holbox!

      <p>Holbox is a little piece of heaven for those of you debating whether or
      not to go visit I highly recommend you do.<br />​​​​​​</p><p>During the
      rainy season it is a bit problematic on this island since they do not have
      cars, only mini golfs, and these mini golfs aren't used during the rain
      since the roads over there get way too muddy, and it ruins the mini golf
      engines on top of all that the mosquitoes come out and eat you alive when
      it rains, so it is no fun.</p>

      either Cancun or Playa del Carmen, but you can also get there from Tulum,
      Merida, and Valladolid.<br />The cheapest way to get to Holbox is by
      public bus and a ferry.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Bus:</strong></h4><p>Take an
      ADO bus. Book your trip online because they fill up
      easily.</p><p><strong>From Cancun to Chiquila:</strong><br

      del Carmen to Chiquila takes around two hours.<br
      />&bull;<strong><em>Cost:</em>&nbsp;</strong>around 276 MXN (13.8
      USD).</p><p><strong>Once you get to Chiquila Port you'll hop on a ferry to
      Isla Holbox!</strong></p><p><strong>&bull;<em>Duration:

      </strong>☆☆☆<br /><strong>Price: </strong>Avrage price is 170 USD per
      night.<br /><strong>Duration of stay: </strong>2 nights<br /><strong>Our
      Experience:&nbsp;</strong>We were told that this is a very excellent hotel
      for honeymooners and we were a little disappointed. The rooms weren't so
      clean, it would also get pretty sandy in the room since the rooms are
      surrounded by sand, and there weren't many options for breakfast.<br />If
      that doesn't bother you, know that it is located right near the center,
      has a beautiful beach, and has friendly staff.</p><h2>WHERE TO EAT IN
      HOLBOX:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;<strong>El Hornito Argento -</strong> Right in
      the center is this Argentinian restaurant with the BEST PIZZA EVER!!!<br
      />&bull;<strong>️Casa Nostra Roof Restaurant -</strong> Great location and
      food.</p>

      <h1>2 Day Itinerary:</h1><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h3><strong>Day
      1:</strong></h3><h2>Playa de Holbox, City Center, and Bioluminescent
      Phytoplanktons tour</h2><p><strong>City Center:</strong><br />Explore the
      art around the city center of Isla Holbox.</p><p><strong>Playa de
      Holbox:</strong><br />The beach with the holbox hammock (10 minute walk
      from Alma bar) Location: L&aacute;zaro C&aacute;rdenas, Chetumal,
      Q.R.</p><p><strong>Bioluminescent Phytoplanktons tour:</strong> Glowing
      Planktons at night is a must must must!!! They pick you up at 4 AM for
      this tour so get to bed early the night before. You can't catch the
      planktons on camera so just go and enjoy the moment. It is
      remarkable!</p><h2><strong>Day 2:</strong></h2><h2>Cabo Catoche Boat tour,
      Beach clubs &amp; Bars.</h2><p><strong>Boat Tour Cabo Catoche:</strong><br
      />Cabo Catoche is the point where the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico
      are found. In this area, you can see incredible scenery with pristine
      beaches. Its lush marine life is the ideal place for fishing and
      snorkeling. If you're lucky, you can spot dolphins and flamingos out in
      the wild.</p><p><strong>El Velero Beach Club:</strong><br />Located close
      to Holbox Dream hotel was this relaxing beach club. It is a great place to
      relax and enjoy good food, shakes, and a beautiful
      beach.</p><p><strong>Alma Bar:</strong><br />This bar has great live
      music, good drinks, and an infinity pool with such a great view of the
      ocean!</p><h2><strong>Don't miss!</strong></h2><p><strong>Whale shark
      snorkeling:</strong></p><p>The season to do so is June until the middle of
      September. Make sure you go when in the season because, after the season,
      there is just NO WAY to see the whale sharks. Sadly we thought the season
      was until the end f September, so we missed them. You Can also see the
      whale sharks in Isla Mujeres.</p>

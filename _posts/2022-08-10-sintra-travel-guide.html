      <p>​​Planning a trip to Sintra, Portugal? In this post, I cover when to
      visit, how long to stay, &nbsp;what to pack, how to get there, the main
      attractions, and some of our tips.</p><p>Sintra is a charming Portuguese
      town located in the Sintra mountains near Lisbon. Its natural beauty and
      architercutre, are the reasons why it's classified by UNESCO as a World
      Heritage site.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>HISTORY OF SINTRA:</h2><p>In the 19th century Sintra became the first
      centre of European Romantic architecture. Ferdinand II turned a ruined
      monastery into a castle where this new sensitivity was displayed in the
      use of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance elements and in the
      creation of a park blending local and exotic species of trees.</p>

      <h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p>The peak season is July-August.
      Sintra is very popular due to its proximity to Lisbon and its charm, in
      order to truly enjoy it, we recommend visiting April-June,
      September-November.<br />Try to avoid weekends in order to beat the
      crowds.</p><h2><strong>HOW LONG TO STAY:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Most people
      visit Sintra on a day trip from Lisbon, which is what we did.<br />We
      spent a whole full day in Sintra but also got to enjoy part of what Sintra
      has to offer.<br />If we could, we'd stay in Sintra overnight and spend at
      least 2 days here in order to explore all 5 palaces and the many
      gardens.</p>

      to Sintra</p><ul><li><strong>Train:&nbsp;</strong>This is the most
      convenient and inexpensive way of reaching Sintra from Lisbon. You take
      the train from the city's central Rossio railway station.<br />The train
      departures daily every 15 minutes, on Saturday and Sunday they run

      <h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p>The peak season is July-August.
      Sintra is very popular due to its proximity to Lisbon and its charm, in
      order to truly enjoy it, we recommend visiting April-June,
      September-November.<br />Try to avoid weekends in order to beat the
      crowds.</p><h3><strong>How long to stay there:</strong></h3><p>Most people
      visit Sintra on a day trip from Lisbon, which is what we did.<br />We
      spent a whole full day in Sintra but also got to enjoy part of what Sintra
      has to offer.<br />If we could, we'd stay in Sintra overnight and spend at
      least 2 days here in order to explore all 5 palaces and the many
      gardens.</p>

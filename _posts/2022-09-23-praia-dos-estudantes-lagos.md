      students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to get there:</h2><p>If you enter Roman
      bridge Lagos into Waze/google maps you won't reach the right place. It'll
      take you to the top of the bridge where the staircase to the beach is
      closed.</p><p>To get to the beach you need to go to Praia dos Estudantes,
      walk down the steps, and on your right, there is a tunnel in the rock that
      will lead you to the Roman
      Bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Parking:</h2><p><strong>&bull; Paid Parking:
      </strong>This is the closest parking to the beach but also the smallest.
      It costs 1.2 Euro for 2 hours</p><p>Located near Mar Restaurant &amp; Bar
      (37.096938, -8.668508)</p><p><strong>&bull; Free parking: </strong>R.
      Bombeiros Volunt&aacute;rios de Lagos (37.096294, -8.670520) or R.

      <h2>When to visit:</h2><p>This beach is located in the center of Lagos
      which means it'll get crowded very quickly. Try to arrive at sunrise
      because they are spectacular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Activities:</h2><p>You
      can rent a kayak from Praia da Batata and see the bridge from the water.
      During high tide, you can even go underneath the bridge by
      kayak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to
      eat:</h2><p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Mar Restaurant &amp; Bar is the
      closest as has an amazing view.</p><p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Old
      Town Lagos is a 10-minute walk and there are plenty of options to eat
      there.</p>

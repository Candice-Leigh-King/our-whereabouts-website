      <h2><strong>HOW TO VISIT THE MONASTERIES:</strong></h2><p>The monasteries
      are all located close to one another therefore it makes it very easy to
      either drive from one monastery to another or walk to them and enjoy the
      view on the wat. Most tour buses arrive with groups to the most popular
      Monastery, which is the Great Meteoron, so make sure to visit the
      Monasteries backward and make your way to Great Meteoron later on when the
      crowd dies out.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>WHAT TO
      WEAR:</strong></h2><p>To enter the monasteries of Meteora a dress code is
      enforced. <strong>Men must wear long pants and women, long
      skirts</strong>. Sleeveless shirts are not allowed. Skirts and trousers
      are provided at the entrance to monasteries, so don't worry too much about
      having them with
      you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>PHOTOGRAPHY:</strong></h2><p><strong>You're
      not allowed to take photos inside the monasteries</strong>. The monks
      don't allow anyone to photograph the interiors of the churches, or in any
      of the museums located inside the Meteora monasteries. Please respect
      them.</p>

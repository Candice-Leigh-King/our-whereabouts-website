      <p>When you think of Greece, you think of turquoise waters, white sandy
      beaches, and windmills, but northern Greece is filled with nature unlike
      anywhere else in the world. Meteora is a place you shouldn't miss while
      visiting Greece. Located in Thessaly area, Meteora, is a group of
      monasteries on the summits of vertical rock formations. The monasteries
      are located just north of the small town of Kalabaka, south of the village
      of Kastraki, and east of the Pindus (P&iacute;ndos)</p><p>There are a few
      ways to get to Meteora and I am going to cover how to get there from
      Thessaloniki or Athens.</p>

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>PLANE:</strong></h2><p>There are no international airports in Meteora therefore if you're coming from out of the country <strong>the best airport</strong> to land in is <strong>Thessaloniki Airport Makedonia.</strong> It is the closest, about 254 km away.</p><p>The other options include:</p><ul><li>Athens Airport (Greece) is about 372 km away.</li><li>Skopje International Airport (North Macedonia) is 212 km away.</li></ul><p>\_</p><h2><strong>CAR:</strong></h2><p>Renting a car might be the most convenient way to explore Meteora and move around at your own pace. For tips on renting a car<a href=\"https://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/tips-for-renting-a-car\"> Click here!</a></p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Renting a car:</strong></h2><p><strong>Where?</strong> Thessaloniki Airport Makedonia. This Airport is located 30 minutes away from the center of Thessaloniki.</p><p><strong>Company:</strong> We rented the car through Budget.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> 146 Euro for an automatic car.</p><p><strong>Gas Cost:</strong> We spent 26 EUR and drove about 476 in total.</p><p><strong>Toll roads: </strong>We spent<strong> </strong>7 EUR in total.</p><p>\_</p><h2><a href=\"https://travel.usnews.com/Monterey_CA/\"><strong>︎</strong></a><strong>Should you rent a car?</strong></h2><p>Our recommendation is YES! Nothing beats the freedom you have when you're driving. Once you leave the city and reach nature it is beautiful.</p><p>You could rely on public transportation but it shouldn't be the first option. There are buses around to the villages near Meteora but and from the villages, you'll either take a taxi or a bus to Meteora. Do remember arrival time will be based on availability and timing of the public transportation.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Do you have to rent a car?</strong></h2><p>No. Saying that a car offers more flexibility and is a time saver.</p><p>\_</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>TRAINS:</strong></h2><p>The second best option is taking the train to Kalabaka, which is the village below Meteora. The name of the train company from both Athens and Thessaloniki is Trainose, you can order tickets online and reserve a spot. Do know that the trains run less frequently on weekends.</p><p><strong>Do take into consideration when using the traveling by train, bus transportation will be required, adding more time to your travel.</strong></p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Trains From Thessaloniki:</strong></h2><p>In order to get a train to Meteora, you have to get to New Railway Station, or<strong> “Neos Sidirodromikos Stathmos”</strong> at Thessaloniki.</p><p>Thessaloniki doesn't have a Metro, so you'll need to take a taxi or bus to the Train Station. If you're coming from the airport you can take the 78 bus to the railway station.</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>27 EURO per adult for one direction.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>about 3 hours. <strong>Direct route: </strong>This route is NOT direct. You'll have to exchange trains at Palaeofarsalos.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Trains From Athens:</strong></h2><p>Trains for Kalabaka leave from <strong>Larissa Train Station</strong>, which is the main train station. To get there, take metro line 2 (Red Line) from the Syntagma stop towards Anthoupoli.</p><h4><strong>Direct Train:</strong></h4><p><strong>Line:&nbsp;</strong>884 ΑΠ<br /><strong>Price: </strong>33 EURO per adult for one direction.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>4 hours.</p><p><strong>Direct route: </strong>Departures every morning at 7:20 am there is a direct train.</p><p>\_</p><h4><strong>Not Direct:</strong></h4><p><strong>Line: </strong>52 IC and 1882 ΑΠ</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>36 EURO per adult for one direction.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>3 hours and 31 minutes.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>BUSES:</strong></h2><p>This is a little trickier than taking a train since you'll have to take public transportation to the bus stop and once you get on the bus in the direction of Meteora you will need to exchange buses at Trikala, which is a city 15 minutes away from Kalabaka. The bus company that runs buses from both Athens and Thessaloniki to Trikala is KTEL Grevenon.</p><p>\_</p><p>Once you're in Kalambaka and you'd like to reach Meteora's Monasteries, here are ways you can do so:</p><ul><li>Hike (3.1km)</li><li>Taxi (4.9km) should cost around 5-7 EURO.</li><li>Bus - There is a bus that runs twice a day and costs 2.7 EURO.</li></ul><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Buses From Thessaloniki:</strong></h2><p>You will need to the bus station (KTEL). Getting to the bus station from the airport is probably the easiest thing in Thessaloniki, as public bus line 78 (or 78N at night) starts at the airport and ends at the bus station. If you're coming from the city you have more bus lines 1, 8, 12, 45, 80, 81, 82A, 82B, 82E, 82K, 89A, 89B.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> 19-25 EURO per person for one way. <strong>Duration: </strong>3 hours 20 minutes. <strong>Operation:</strong> It runs 3 times a week.</p><p>\_</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Buses From Athens:</strong></h2><p>You will need to get to the<strong> Liosion Bus Terminal (KTEL) </strong>To get there, take metro 1 (Green line) at the Monastiraki stop in the Athens city center.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> 31 EURO per person for one way.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>4 hours and 45 minutes. <strong>Operation:</strong> It runs 6 times a week.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>DAILY TOURS:</strong></h2><p>Most people go to Meteora for one day. We spent 3 days and recommend you visit for at least 2 days.</p><p>There are quite a few options here are just a few so you get an understanding of the trip:</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Meteora Day Trip by Train from Athens - 107$</strong></h2><p>\_</p><ul><li>What it includes: Round-trip shared transfers in Kalabaka, Round-trip rail tickets based on your choice, Expert English speaking escort, Transport by air-conditioned vehicle with WiFi, Panoramic views of the six active monasteries, Visit three Monasteries and the hermit caves of Badovas, Free Map and bottle of water, Local taxes.</li><li>Doesn't include: Hotel pick-up and drop-off service in Athens, Food and drinks, Entrance fees of the Monasteries (Each is 3 EURO).<br /><br />\_</li></ul><h2><strong>Meteora Day Trip from Thessaloniki - 63.97$</strong></h2><p>\_</p><ul><li>What it includes: Round-trip shared transfers in Kalabaka, Round-trip rail tickets based on your choice, Expert English speaking escort, Transport by air-conditioned vehicle with WiFi, Panoramic views of the six active monasteries, Visit three Monasteries and the hermit caves of Badovas, Free Map and bottle of water, Local taxes</li><li>Doesn't include: Hotel pick-up and drop-off service in Athens, Food and drinks, Entrance fees of the Monasteries</li></ul>"

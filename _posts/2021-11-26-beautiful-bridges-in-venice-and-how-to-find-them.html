      <h2><strong>CALLE DRIO CHIESA BRIDGE</strong></h2><p><strong>District: San
      Marco.<br />Location: Near Teatro La Fenice.</strong></p><p>Enter 'Hotel
      San Moise' into your google maps. Once you see the hotel on your right
      you'll find a small dock on your left where this photo was taken. Not many
      people know about this spot and the location of it makes it invisible to
      those who aren't aware of this
      spot.</p><h4><strong>Coordinates:</strong></h4><p>45.433443, 12.335059</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE MARIA CALLAS BRIDGE</strong></h2><p><strong>District:
      San Marco.<br />Location: Near Teatro La Fenice</strong></p><p>This
      beautiful bridge on a very small canal is hidden between the buildings,
      which creates a very cozy and picturesque spot. What adds even more charm
      to it is the Santo Stefano bell tower behind.</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE DEI SOPIRI</strong></h2><p><strong>District: San
      Marco.<br />Location: Near Basilica di San Marco.</strong></p><p>There are
      four different angles where you can capture a photo with this
      bridge:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Ponte della Paglia: It's a bridge
      right next to St. Mark's square and just behind the Doge's
      Palace.</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Below Ponte della Pagila when
      facing the Bridge of Sighs walk to your right off the bridge and make a
      left turn to an alley for this cool spot.</p><p><strong>Option 3:</strong>
      The bridge near Trattoria Canonica&rlm; restaurant.</p><p><strong>Option
      4:</strong> Gondola ride. This is a great option, but an expensive one.
      (Most expensive option..)</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE DEL PARADISO</strong></h2><p><strong>District: Castello.
      </strong><br /><strong>Location: Near Campo S. M.
      Formosa.</strong></p><p>Crossing the Rio del Mondo Novo, the bridge is
      almost entirely constructed out of Istrian stone bricks while the steps
      are paved with Trachyte. As you reach the bridge you'll notice a arch
      connected by the side buildings known as the arch of Madonna della
      Misericordia.</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE PASQUALIGO E AVOGADRO</strong></h2><p><strong>District:
      Castello.<br />Location: Near Fondazione Querini Stampalia
      Museum.</strong></p><p>This is a very charming area that we happened to
      find while getting lost. It has a few really neat bridges and balconies
      that is worth checking
      out.</p><h4><strong>Coordinates:</strong></h4><p>45.436508, 12.340923</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE RIALTO</strong></h2><p><strong>District: Connects San
      Marco and San Polo. Location: Near Church of San Bartolomeo di
      Rialto.</strong></p><p>One of the most famous bridges in Venice and for a
      good reason. It is the first bridge built across the Gran Canal which
      makes it also the oldest one out of only 4 bridges that are crossing this
      main canal of Venice. 3 ways of photographing this
      bridge:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> On the San Marco side there are a
      few docks on the Gran Canal but the best one is closest to the
      bridge.</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> On the San Polo side you'll find
      a cute little spot in front of Palazzo dei
      Camerlenghi.</p><h4><strong>Coordinates for this spot in
      photo:</strong></h4><p>45.4384198, 12.3359621.</p><p><strong>Option
      3:</strong> Gondola ride. This is a great option, but an expensive one.

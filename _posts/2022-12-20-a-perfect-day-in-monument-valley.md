  title: A Perfect Day in Monument Valley
  description: >-
    During our southwest road trip we drove from Page, Arizona to Moab, Utah -
    passing by Monument Valley. Most people drive through Monument Valley and go
    straight to the Forrest Gump spot, but Monument Valley is such an iconic and
    beautiful place, it has so much to offer. You'll want to spend at least a
    full day here to truly enjoy everything it has to offer.


    Here's how to spend a day in Monument Valley.

      <h2>1. The Monument Valley Scenic Drive:</h2><p>The Monument Valley Navajo
      Tribal Park has a beautiful 17-mile loop road &amp; it's worth
      visiting.</p><p>Cost: $8 per person<br />You can self-drive this loop
      it&rsquo;s a little bumpy &amp; dusty, but we did it with our rental car
      with no problems.<br />If it rains, this road can become impassable so
      check the weather before your visit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Stops along the
      way:</h3><p><strong>&bull;The wildcat Trail: </strong>This hike is a
      3.2-mile loop that circles around the Mitten Buttes and Merrick Butte
      &amp; offers incredible views.<br /><strong>&bull;The Mittens &amp;
      Merrick Butte:</strong> This stop is a great spot to get up close to these
      monuments.<br /><strong>&bull;The Three Sisters: </strong>Opposite the
      Mittens, you&rsquo;ll find the Three Sisters. These three finger-like
      stones rise out of the red rock.<br /><strong>&bull;John Ford&rsquo;s
      point: </strong>This is our favorite and most iconic spot on the loop.
      Named after film director John Ford, who filmed Stagecoach. For 5$ you can
      even take an iconic shot on a horse.<br /><strong>&bull;Totem pole:
      </strong>It is an incredible and remarkable rock feature. It is the
      tallest spire in the world at a prominence of 381 feet.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Artist&rsquo;s point: </strong>Another popular scenic
      point.</p>

      <h2><strong>2. Forrest Gump Spot:</strong></h2><p>This is the most famous
      spot. It's best to visit this spot in the morning or early afternoon
      because, in the late afternoon and early evening, you'll be facing the
      sun. The speed limit on this road is 65 mph, so it is important to watch
      for cars because this road gets busy, especially in the afternoon.</p>

      <h2><strong>3. The Mexican Hat:</strong></h2><p>The Mexican Hat is a
      unique natural rock formation that looks like a Mexican hat located
      outside of the formal park.</p>

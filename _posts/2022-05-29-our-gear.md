      <p>As conent creators we get asked what gear we use. I will be updating
      this post every once and a while</p><blockquote><h4>They say: the best
      camera is the one you have with you</h4></blockquote>

      <h2><strong>Camera:</strong></h2><p>Canon M50 Mark II.&nbsp;</p><p>The M50
      is Canon's very first Mirrorless camera and it is a great start for those
      wanting to get quality photos on a budget. We love it also because it is
      lightweight and perfect for traveling.</p>

      <h2><strong>Lenses and Extras for
      Camera:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Canon EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 IS STM
      -</p><p>This is the lens that comes with the Camera. It is simple and
      great for portrait photos.</p><p>Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS
      STM&nbsp; -</p><p>This is our telephoto and it is a game-changer. It takes
      your photos to a whole new level.<br />​​​​​</p><p>San Disk SD Card - 2TB
      -</p><p>You're going to want to buy this if you're shooting RAW
      images.</p><p>Canon LP-E12 Batteries -</p><p>We have 4 of these because we
      found that the batteries can last somewhere between 1-4hours. If you're
      out for a full day and love to take photos as much as we do, You're going
      to want at least 3 batteries.</p>

      <p><strong>Drone:</strong></p><p>We just purchased our first drone DJI
      Mini 3 Pro.</p><p>We are still learning how to use it but it's perfect for
      content creators since it's got an option to take content vertically and
      it is lightweight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><b>Tripod</b></h2><p><strong>UBeesize TR50</strong></p><p>This has
      been a really great tripod for beginners. It is affordable, lightweights
      and comes with a remote for your phone.</p><p>We just invested in a new
      tripod - Peak Design Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod and we will give our
      review on it later on.</p>

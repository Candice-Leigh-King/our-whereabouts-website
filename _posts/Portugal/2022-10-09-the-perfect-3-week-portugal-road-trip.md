      as magical.<br /><strong>&bull;Old Town Lagos:</strong> Explore Old Town
      Lagos, it is a charming place filled with nightlife, restaurants, and gift
      shops.</p><h2>Day 21:&nbsp; Sagres</h2><p><strong>&bull;Sagres
      Fortress:&nbsp;</strong>Known as the edge of the world, this fortress was
      built to protect Portugal against the Moors. However, the original
      structure was severely damaged by the 1755 earthquake. It's got dramatic
      cliffs, a small church, a maze, and beautiful views. I would definitely
      recommend visiting if you're in the area, however, I wouldn't go out of my
      way to visit.<br />Entrance Fee: 3 Euro per person<br />Duration of stay:
      You'll need more than an hour to properly stroll around and see<br
      /><strong>&bull;Praia das Arrifana:&nbsp;</strong>One of the most
      beautiful view, beach towns, on the coast of Portugal, with a spectacular
      cliff view, a little restaurant, and surfing.<br /><strong>&bull;Costa
      Vicentina:&nbsp;</strong>Well maintained, beautiful trails with beautiful
      views of the ocean. Breathtaking cliffs, caves, Garrison, and a chapel.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Cabo S&atilde;o Vicente: </strong>Considered the edge of
      the world, this spot is definitely worth visiting.</p><p><em>âžŸ Drive 3

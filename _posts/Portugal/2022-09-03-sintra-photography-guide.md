      <h2>The Pena Palace:</h2><p><strong>The best time to arrive is between 9

      <h2>The Moorish Castle:</h2><p><strong>The best time to arrive is 9 am to
      12 pm.</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p>Many visitors to Sintra overlook the
      Moorish Castle, but you shouldn't because it offers one of the best views
      of Sintra! The Moorish castle was built in the 8th century and resembles
      the wall of China, making it a fantastic location to explore.</p>

      <h2>Old Town of Sintra:</h2><p><strong>The best time to visit: all
      day.</strong></p><p>The historic town of Sintra is nestled among several
      steep hills dominated by the Moorish castle and Pena palace. It's a
      beautiful small compact area to spend an afternoon.​​​​​​</p><h2>Sintra
      National Palace:</h2><p><strong>The best time to visit: All
      day.</strong></p><p>Let me start by saying that we didn't plan on visiting
      Sintra National Palace, we wanted to visit Monserrate Palace. Still, we
      accidentally purchased tickets to Sintra National Palace, so after
      grabbing lunch in the center of town, we decided to hop on in to take a
      glance at the interior of the palace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Moorish
      Fountain:</h2><p><strong>The best time to visit: All
      day.</strong></p><p>Fonte Mourisca or the Moorish Fountain is a public
      water fountain sited by the roadside on the Volta do Duche in Sintra,
      between Sintra National Palace and Quinta da Regaleira.</p>

      <h2>The Monserrate Palace:</h2><p><strong>The best time to arrive is 9 am
      to 10 pm or 5 pm to 6 pm.</strong></p><p>Hidden in the lush green Sintra
      mountain, lies this beautiful palace. You walk through a beautiful garden
      that leads up to the palace. There are several hiking trails that take you
      to the palace. You can also visit the pastel palace from the inside. The
      palace itself is not very big, but the combination with the beautiful
      garden makes a visit to this palace really
      worthwhile!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Monserrate Chapel
      Ruins:</h2><p><strong>The best time to arrive: All
      day.</strong></p><p>False ruin designed by Francis Cook created out of the
      chapel built by Gerard de Visme in replacement of the former Chapel of Our
      Lady of Monserrate. Engulfed by vegetation, the ruin is now inherently
      bound up with the adjoining Australian rubber tree.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Quinta da Regaleira:</h2><p><strong>The best time to arrive is 10 am
      to 12 pm or 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.</strong></p><p>This Gothic palace is a
      must-visit landmark visiting Sintra and has to be our favorite palace. The
      opulent palace has spectacular gardens with a surrealistic initiation well
      and ornate follies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Initiation
      Well:</h2><p><strong>Best time to arrive is 10 am or 6:30
      pm.</strong></p><p>The Initiation Well is an 8-foot-deep spiral staircase
      that descends into underground tunnels. The stone staircase is hollow in
      the center with a compass-patterned floor at the bottom. The well was
      never built to serve as a water resource and was never used as a well, it
      was actually built for secret ceremonial purposes. It is believed that the
      spacing of these landings, as well as the number of steps in between, are
      linked to Tarot mysticism and Masonic principles.</p>

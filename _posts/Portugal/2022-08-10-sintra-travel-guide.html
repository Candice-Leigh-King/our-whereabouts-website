      <p>​​Planning a trip to Sintra, Portugal? In this post, I cover when to
      visit, how long to stay, &nbsp;what to pack, how to get there, the main
      attractions, and some of our tips.</p><p>Sintra is a charming Portuguese
      town located in the Sintra mountains near Lisbon. Its natural beauty and
      architecture, are the reasons why it's classified by UNESCO as a World
      Heritage site.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>HISTORY OF SINTRA:</h2><p>In the 19th century Sintra became the first
      centre of European Romantic architecture. Ferdinand II turned a ruined
      monastery into a castle where this new sensitivity was displayed in the
      use of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance elements and in the
      creation of a park blending local and exotic species of
      trees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>HOW TO GET THERE:</strong></h2><p>There
      are a few ways to get to
      Sintra</p><ul><li><strong>Train:&nbsp;</strong>This is the most convenient
      and inexpensive way of reaching Sintra from Lisbon. You take the train
      from the city's central Rossio railway station.<br />The train departures
      daily every 15 minutes, on Saturday and Sunday they run hourly.<br
      />Duration: 40 minutes<br />Cost: 4.3
      EUR.</li><li><strong>Buses:&nbsp;</strong>Do know there aren't direct
      buses from Lisbon to Sintra.</li><li><strong>Car:&nbsp;</strong>You can
      always drive to Sintra but do know that parking is minimal and the roads
      are very narrow you can get stuck in still traffic most of the
      day.</li><li><strong>Tour: </strong>There are many tours from Lisbon to
      Sintra that includes various spots around Sintra.<br />Cost: Prices start
      at 61$ per person and could go up to 200$</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p>The peak season is July-August.
      Sintra is very popular due to its proximity to Lisbon and its charm, in
      order to truly enjoy it, we recommend visiting April-June,
      September-November.<br />Try to avoid weekends in order to beat the
      crowds.</p><h2><strong>HOW LONG TO STAY:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Most people
      visit Sintra on a day trip from Lisbon, which is what we did.<br />We
      spent a whole full day in Sintra but also got to enjoy part of what Sintra
      has to offer.<br />If we could, we'd stay in Sintra overnight and spend at
      least 2 days here in order to explore all 5 palaces and the many
      gardens.</p>

      <h2>HOW TO GET AROUND SINTRA:</h2><p>Since we don't recommend driving in
      Sintra, the most affordable way to get around is by taking the buses or
      Uber. There are a few ways to get around
      Sintra:</p><ul><li><strong>Buses</strong>:&nbsp;<p>Bus 434 circular route:
      Sintra Train Station - Historic Center - Moorish Castle - Pena Palace and
      Park - Historic Center - Sintra Train Station<br />Bus 435: Monserrate
      Palace, Seteais Palace, and Quinta da Regaleira. The start and end point
      is at the historic center. This line runs every 25 minutes.<br />The
      tickets for both buses can be purchased directly from the driver.<br
      />Cost: 3.5 EUR.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tuk-tuk:</strong> There are always
      so many Tuk-tuks around Sintra, the problem is they don't have a set rate
      and each driver gives a different
      price.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taxis:</strong> They are metered taxis. From
      Quinta da Regaleira to the train station it cost at least &euro;10 and
      probably more if there is lots of
      traffic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uber:&nbsp;</strong>The uber drivers are
      located at the train station of Sintra (which is about 15 minutes away
      from the palaces) once you order one from the palaces it can take them
      15-20 minutes to arrive to you, and sometimes they might accept your ride
      and then cancel it midway.</p></li><li><p><strong>Walking: </strong>Sintra
      is small enough that many area attractions can be accessed on foot. If you
      plan your trip correctly, you can mix up public transportation with
      walking since some spots are within walking distance of each other. For
      exmaple: Pena Palace &amp; Moorish Castle, National Palace of Sintra,
      Quinta da Regaleira &amp; Monserrate
      Palace</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>WHAT TO
      PACK:</strong></h2><ul><li>Snacks and
      food</li><li>Water</li><li>Hat</li><li>Sunglasses</li><li>An extra layer
      since it gets chilly in the early morning/late
      evening.</li><li>Comfortable shoes</li><li>Sunscreen</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>FOOD:</strong></h2><p>We were told that there isn't much to
      eat there but they do have Kiyosks and coffee shops at the palaces, the
      center of town, and by the train station of
      Sintra.</p><ul><li><strong>Pena Palace: </strong>Palace Restaurant, Palace
      Cafeteria, Terrace Bar, and Riding Ring Kiosk</li><li><p><strong>Moorish
      Castle:</strong> There is a little cafe near the entrance with drinks,
      snacks and sandwiches.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>National Palace of
      Sintra:</strong> Robillion Pavillion
      Cafeteria&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Monserrate Palace -
      </strong>Monserrate's Tea House&nbsp;</p></li></ul>

      <h2>TIPS:</h2><ul><li>Plan ahead of time which places you want to
      see.</li><li>Don't visit more than 3 palaces for a day.</li><li>Start with
      the most popular spots.</li><li>The first and last hours of the day is the
      least busy time.</li><li>Purchase combo Tickets: If you're planning on
      visiting a few palaces, buy a combo ticket for them, they are cheaper that
      way.</li></ul><h2>MAIN ATTRACTIONS:</h2><ul><li>Old Town of
      Sinta</li><li>National Palace of Sintra</li><li>Pena
      Palace</li><li>Monserrate Palace</li><li>Moorish Castle</li><li>Quinta
      &nbsp;da Regaleira</li></ul>

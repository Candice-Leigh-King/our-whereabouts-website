      <h1><strong>History of the Palace:</strong></h1><p>In the 15th century,
      King Manuel I ordered a monastery built for the Order of Saint Jerome that
      could host 18 monks. However, this monastery was severely damaged by
      lightning in the 18th century.</p><p>In the early 19th century, King
      consort Ferdinand II decided to acquire the surrounding land to build a
      summer residence for the royal family. Unfortunately, the royal family had
      to flee the state during the revolution of 1910, and the state later
      purchased it and turned it into a museum.</p>

      <h2><strong>Entrance
      Fee:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>Palace:</strong><br />&bull;Adults: 7.5
      Euro.<br />&bull;Kids (age 6 - 17): 6.5 Euro.</p><p><strong>Palace and
      Park:</strong><br />&bull;Adults: 14 Euro.<br />&bull;Kids (age 6-17):
      12.5 Euro.</p><h2><strong>Opening
      Hours:</strong></h2><p><strong>Palace:</strong><br />9:30 am - 6:30 pm<br
      />&bull;Last ticket and admission: 6:00 pm<br />&bull;There are automatic
      ticket vending machines are available on
      site.</p><p><strong>Park:</strong><br />9:00 am - 7:00 pm<br />&bull;Last
      ticket and admission: 6:00 pm</p><h2><strong>When to
      arrive:</strong></h2><p>If you'd like to have the place to yourselves, we
      recommend arriving 15 minutes before opening hours and being the first to
      enter the park.<br />It is most crowded between 10 am to 3 pm because the
      tourist groups arrive around that time.&nbsp;</p><p>&bull;The peak season
      is April-September. Try to avoid weekends to beat the
      crowds.</p><h2><strong>Duration of stay:</strong></h2><p>If you're just
      touring the gardens and terraces, you can easily spend an hour or two (We
      were there for 2 hours). If you're also touring the interior of the
      Palace, you'll need 2-3 hours.</p><h2><strong>Interior of
      Palace:</strong></h2><p>Arrive as early as possible since the lines can
      get up to two hours.</p>

      <h1><strong>How to get there:</strong></h1><p>Check out my blog<a
      href="https://ourwhereabouts.com/travel/2022/08/10/sintra-travel-guide.html">
      Sintra Travel Guide</a> for more
      information</p><h1><strong>Tickets:</strong></h1><p>It's best to buy
      tickets online to save time waiting in line; however, If you don't, there
      are a few electronic ticket
      booths.</p><h1><strong>Shuttles:</strong></h1><p>Once you arrive at the
      entrance to Pena Palace, you've got to walk uphill. To avoid walking
      uphill and to save time, you can buy shuttle tickets (the shuttle tickets
      can be purchased with an entrance ticket
      online)</p><h1><strong>Parking:</strong></h1><p>There are several parking
      lots nearby, but they get full quickly, so if you're driving, arrive
      early.</p><h1><strong>Food:</strong></h1><p>&bull;Palace Restaurant<br
      />&bull;Palace Cafeteria<br />&bull;Terrace Bar<br />&bull;Riding Ring
      Kiosk</p><h1><strong>Restrooms:</strong></h1><p>Right next to the Palace,
      there are nice clean restrooms.</p>

      <h1><strong>Our tips:</strong></h1><p>&bull;Bring something small to eat
      because there aren&rsquo;t any cheap places near the palace and it's a
      long walk to the city center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>​​&bull;You're not allowed
      to take pictures inside the palace staterooms, but you can capture as many
      photos on the terraces.</p><h1><strong>Main
      Attractions:</strong></h1><p>&bull;Monumental Gate<br />&bull;Sentry
      Walk<br />&bull;Courtyard of Arches<br />&bull;Triton&rsquo;s Terrace<br
      />&bull;Coach House&rsquo;s Terrace<br />&bull;Interior of Palace<br

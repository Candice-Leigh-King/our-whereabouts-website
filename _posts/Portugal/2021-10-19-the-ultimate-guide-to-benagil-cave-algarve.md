      <h2>Our Tip:</h2><p>If you're booking a boat tour, do your research on
      what boat you're getting on because the smaller the boat, the better. The
      big boats DO NOT enter the cave even if they are called 'Benagil cave boat
      tour'.</p><p>You can swim from the beach around the edge of the cliff to
      the entrance but it it unadvised for inexperienced swimmers. If you plan
      on doing so, check the weather before you go swimming there.</p><p>While
      Benagil is a very small little village in the Algarve, there are many of
      great restaurants you can eat at after your activity.&nbsp;</p>

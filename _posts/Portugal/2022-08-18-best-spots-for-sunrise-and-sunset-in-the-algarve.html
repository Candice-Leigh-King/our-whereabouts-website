      <h2>Lagoa:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Praia da Marinha: ​​​​​</strong>The most
      popular and visited the beach, but for a good reason! It is one of the
      most beautiful beaches in the Algarve. There are plenty of other small
      beaches you can swim in the area, cool rock formations with explorable
      caves and tunnels. Walk a few kilometers along the marked trail towards
      Benagil to enjoy the view of this spectacular beach to the fullest.<br
      /><strong>The best time to visit: </strong>sunrise and sunset.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color:
      var(--color-carbon); font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing:
      0.01rem;"><strong>Praia da Mesquita: </strong>Most people view this beach
      from above but this beach brings you up close with the double arch in the
      ocean.<br /><strong>The best time to
      visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunset.</span><br
      />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Capela da Nossa Senhora da Rocha:</strong>
      A small and charming white Chapel on the top of a cliff overlooking
      beaches from both sides.<br /><strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunrises and sunsets are magical here.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><br />Lagos:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Lagos Roman
      Bridge/ Praia dos Estudantes:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of Lagos&rsquo;s
      most photographed beaches due to the famous Roman Bridge, which linked the
      mainland with Pinhao Fortress. It's called the Student beach because
      it&rsquo;s a small beach that can fit a class of students<br /><strong>The
      best time to visit:</strong> Sunrise.<br />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><span
      style="font-size: var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon);
      font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;"><strong>Praia
      Dona Ana: </strong>This beach has golden sand and many beautiful
      shells.<br />​​​​​​<strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunrise.</span><br />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Praia do
      Camilo:&nbsp;</strong>a very scenic beach, but quite narrow, so it gets
      busy very quickly. You can access 2 other small beaches from there. Before
      you go down to the beach, you can enjoy the view from above. It is
      stunning.<br /><strong>The best time to visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunrise.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ponta da Piedade: </strong>Once you park,
      you'll find a path with many steps that leads to a small platform in the
      ocean where you can rent a boat and explore caves. Walking down, you'll
      enjoy the beautiful view and natural arches. Take into consideration that
      if you come mid-day it gets very crowded and it isn't as magical.<br
      /><strong>The best time to visit: </strong>Sunrise.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Praia Porto de M&oacute;s: </strong>A
      great surfing beach.<br /><strong>​​​​​​The best time to
      visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunset.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>​​​​​Carvoeiro:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Algar
      Seco:&nbsp;</strong>A man-made cave with two windows, benches, and a great
      view of the ocean. It is very accessible, and the whole area offers great
      views.<br /><strong>The best time to
      visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunset</p></li><li><p><span style="font-size:
      var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon); font-family:
      var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;"><strong>Praia de Carvoeiro:
      </strong>This is a popular and most visited beach in Carvoeiro because the
      background of the beach is the picturesque and colorful village of
      Carvoeiro.<br /><strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunrise.</span><br />&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Albandeira
      Beach:&nbsp;</strong>This beach has a stunning rock formation in the shape
      of an arch. There are plenty of cool caves nearby that you can explore.
      The beach is so quiet and secluded.<br /><strong>The best time to
      visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunrise.</p></li></ul>

      <h2>Alvor:&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>&bull;Praia dos Tr&ecirc;s
      Irm&atilde;os:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of our favorite beaches. Tucked
      away in Portim&atilde;o, you'll find this beach with dramatic rock
      formations, pure golden sand, and clear blue water.<br /><strong>The best
      time to visit:</strong> Sunrise because of the colors and the tide is
      low.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Albufeira:&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>&bull;Praia da
      Fal&eacute;sia:</strong>&nbsp;One of my favorite beaches in the Algarve,
      possibly even the world. The contrast between the orange cliffs, the
      ocean, and the green trees is mesmerizing.&bull;After you enjoy the beach
      don't forget to go to the top of the cliffs for a spectacular view.<br
      /><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Sunset is best but you can also
      enjoy the sunrise here.<br
      />&nbsp;</p><h2>Sagres:&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>&bull;Cabo S&atilde;o
      Vicente: </strong>Considered the edge of the world, this spot is
      definitely worth visiting.<br /><strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunset</p>

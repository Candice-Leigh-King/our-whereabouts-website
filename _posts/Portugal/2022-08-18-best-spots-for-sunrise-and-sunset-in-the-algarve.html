      <h2>Lagoa:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Praia da Marinha: ​​​​​</strong>The most
      popular and visited beach, but for a good reason! It is one of the most
      beautiful beaches in the Algarve. There are plenty of other small beaches
      you can swim in the area, cool rock formations with explorable caves and
      tunnels. Walk a few kilometers along the marked trail towards Benagil to
      enjoy the view of this spectacular beach to the fullest.<br /><strong>The
      best time to visit: </strong>sunrise and sunset</p></li><li><p><span
      style="font-size: var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon);
      font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">Praia da
      Mesquita - best time is sunset</span></p></li><li><p>Capela da Nossa
      Senhora da Rocha - sunrises and sunsets are magical here. It's a small
      chapel on a cliff.</p></li></ul><h2><br
      />Lagos:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Lagos Roman Bridge/ Praia dos
      Estudantes:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of Lagos&rsquo;s most photographed
      beaches due to the famous Roman Bridge, which linked the mainland with
      Pinhao Fortress. It's called the Student beach because it&rsquo;s a small
      beach that can fit a class of students<br /><strong>The best time to
      visit:</strong> Sunrise.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-size:
      var(--font-size); color: var(--color-carbon); font-family:
      var(--font-family); letter-spacing: 0.01rem;"><strong>Praia Dona Ana:
      </strong>This beach has golden sand and many beautiful shells.<br
      />​​​​​​<strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunrise</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Praia do
      Camilo:&nbsp;</strong>a very scenic beach, but quite narrow, so it gets
      busy very quickly. You can access 2 other small beaches from there. Before
      you go down to the beach, you can enjoy the view from above. It is
      stunning.<br /><strong>The best time to
      visit:&nbsp;</strong>Sunrise</p></li><li><p><strong>Ponta da Piedade:
      </strong>Once you park, you'll find a path with many steps that leads to a
      small platform in the ocean where you can rent a boat and explore caves.
      Walking down, you'll enjoy the beautiful view and natural arches. Take
      into consideration that if you come mid-day it gets very crowded and it
      isn't as magical.<br /><strong>The best time to visit:
      </strong>Sunrise</p></li><li><p>Porto de Mos - best spot for sunset.<br
      />&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>​​​​​Carvoeiro:</h2><ul><li>Algar Seco -
      Sunset</li><li><p><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color:
      var(--color-carbon); font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing:
      0.01rem;">Praia de Carvoeiro - sunrise</span></p></li><li><p>Albandeira
      Beach - Sunrise.</p></li></ul>

      <h2>Alvor:&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Praia dos Tr&ecirc;s
      Irm&atilde;os:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of our favorite beaches. Tucked
      away in Portim&atilde;o, you'll find this beach with dramatic rock
      formations, pure golden sand, and clear blue water.<br /><strong>The best
      time to visit:</strong> Sunrise because of the colors and the tide is
      low.</p><h2>Albufeira:&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Praia da
      Fal&eacute;sia:</strong>&nbsp;One of my favorite beaches in the Algarve,
      possibly even the world. The contrast between the orange cliffs, the
      ocean, and the green trees is mesmerizing.&bull;After you enjoy the beach
      don't forget to go to the top of the cliffs for a spectacular view.<br
      /><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Sunset is best but you can also
      enjoy the sunrise here.</p><h2>Sagres:&nbsp;</h2><p>Cabo S&atilde;o
      Vicente - sunsets here are magical.</p>

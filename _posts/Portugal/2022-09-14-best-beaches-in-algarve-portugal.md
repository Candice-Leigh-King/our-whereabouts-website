      <h2>Praia dos Tr&ecirc;s Irm&atilde;os</h2><p>This is one of our favorite
      beaches. Tucked away in Portim&atilde;o, you'll find this beach with
      dramatic rock formations, pure golden sand, and clear blue water.<br
      />&bull;When to visit: The golden hours are the best time, and just make
      sure to go when the tide is low.</p><h2>Marinha Beach</h2><p>The most
      popular and visited beach, but for a good reason! It is one of the most
      beautiful beaches in the Algarve. There are plenty of other small beaches
      you can swim in the area, cool rock formations with explorable caves and
      tunnels. Walk a few kilometers along the marked trail towards Benagil to
      enjoy the view of this spectacular beach to the fullest.</p><h2>Praia da
      Fal&eacute;sia</h2><p>One of my favorite beaches in the Algarve, possibly
      even the world. The contrast between the orange cliffs, the ocean, and the
      green trees is mesmerizing.<br />&bull;After you enjoy the beach don't
      forget to go to the top of the cliffs for a spectacular view.</p><h2>Praia
      de Carvoeiro</h2><p>It is a horseshoe-shaped beach surrounded by sandstone
      cliffs. Its golden sand looking at the Ocean on one side &amp; boats,
      restaurants &amp; whitewashed Mediterranean houses on the other side make
      it one of the Algarve's best beaches.</p><h2>Praia dos
      Caneiros</h2><p>It's a very small beach but a hidden gem. This beach has
      golden sand, great views, and a restaurant (with bathrooms) called Rei dos
      Praias with a rooftop</p>

      <h2>Albandeira Beach</h2><p>This beach has a stunning rock formation in
      the shape of an arch. There are plenty of cool caves nearby that you can
      explore. The beach is so quiet and secluded.</p><h2>Ponta da
      Piedade</h2><p>Once you park, you'll find a path with many steps that
      leads to a small platform in the ocean where you can rent a boat and
      explore caves. Walking down, you'll enjoy the beautiful view and natural
      arches. Take into consideration that if you come mid-day it gets very
      crowded and it isn't as magical.</p><h2>Praia Dona Ana</h2><p>This beach
      has golden sand and many beautiful shells. It is best to come for
      sunrise.</p><h2>Praia do Camilo</h2><p>a very scenic beach, but quite
      narrow, so it gets busy very quickly. You can access 2 other small beaches
      from there. Before you go down to the beach, you can enjoy the view from
      above. It is stunning.</p><h2>Praia dos Estudantes</h2><p>This is one of
      Lagos&rsquo;s most photographed beaches due to the famous Roman Bridge,
      which linked the mainland with Pinhao Fortress. It's called the Student
      beach because it&rsquo;s a small beach that can fit a class of
      students</p>

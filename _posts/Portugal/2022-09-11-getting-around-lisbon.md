      <h2>Walking:</h2><p>Although walking around Lisbon can be very tiring due
      to it's hills, steep inclines and many steps, it is very easy city to
      navigate.</p><p>Don't forget to wearing comfortable shoes and have
      water.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Public Transportation:</h2><p>There is a
      travel card called Viva Viagem that costs 0.50 Euro(0.60$) and you can use
      it on ALL transpotation in Lisbon. There are vending machines where you
      can purchase and add credit to the card.<br />You can also get a 24-hour
      unlimited pass for 6.40 Euros. This fare includes all Lisbon buses and
      trams.</p><h3>Tram 28:</h3><p>Riding the Tram 28 is iconic but isn't the
      most practical way of getting around the city.<br />Also, beware, it gets
      VERY crowded and there are many pickpockets on the
      tram.</p><h3>Buses</h3><p>Buses are also a great option to get around but
      they tend to get very croswded by locals, so avoid rush
      hours.</p><h3>Metro</h3><p>This is a really great and quick option to get
      around the city. The entrances to the Metro are marked with a large
      &ldquo;M,&rdquo; and the stations are air-conditioned and
      clean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Uber</h3><p>This is the easiest ways to get
      around. An Uber ride in Lisbon is relatively low and can cost an average
      of 6 USD for a 10-20 minute ride.</p><p>&bull;We spent in total 63 Euro on
      12 rides within the 2.5 days we spent in Lisbon.</p><p>&bull;When you
      order an Uber, you have to be at the pick up spot or he will charge you
      and not wait for you.</p><p>&bull;At the airport you can't take an Uber,
      only taxis. The taxis aren't too expensive, a drive from the airport to
      the city center of about 25 minutes, cost us 12.75 Euros (about 13.7$).
      UBER, very simple and easy to use, Just sign up, put in a credit card and
      you are ready.</p>

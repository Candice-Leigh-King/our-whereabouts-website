      <p><strong>5. EUROPE'S WESTERNMOST POINT</strong></p><p>You can find
      Europe&rsquo;s Westernmost Point In Portugal - Cabo da Roca. It isn't too
      far away from Sintra so if you're spending two days in Sintra it is worth
      checking out this beautiful point.</p><p><strong>6. MOST BEAUTIFUL
      MCDONALD'S</strong></p><p>Portugal Is home to the world&rsquo;s most
      beautiful McDonald&rsquo;s. Located in Porto you'll find a McDonald's that

      cinnamon among other spices to the Western world. In 1498, the Portuguese
      explorer Vasco da Gama made the first sea voyage from Europe to India. The
      mission was driven by a desire to find a direct route to the places where
      spices were plentiful and cheap, cutting out the middlemen. His arrival on
      India&rsquo;s Malabar Coast, the heart of the spice trade, marked the
      start of direct trading between Europe and South East
      Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      Portugal is considered the 3rd safest country in the world and has a very
      low crime rate.</p><p>The people were very very nice to us, waiters
      laughed with us, shop assistants were always smiling and nice, everyone
      helped us when we needed to, Uber drivers spoke to us very nicely, told us
      stories, and even cops we asked for guidance happily helped us. There was
      a very good atmosphere and we do not say that everywhere.</p><p><strong>9.
      CORKS</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: var(--font-size); color:
      var(--color-carbon); font-family: var(--font-family); letter-spacing:

      Portugal which is really cool.</span></p><p><strong>10. LONGEST

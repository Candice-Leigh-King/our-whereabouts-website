  title: National Palace of Sintra
  description: >-
    Let me start by saying that we didn't plan on visiting Sintra National
    Palace, we wanted to visit Monserrate Palace. Still, we accidentally
    purchased tickets to Sintra National Palace, so after grabbing lunch in the
    center of town, we decided to hop on in to take a glance at the interior of
    the palace.

      <h1><strong>History of the Palace:</strong></h1><p>The National Palace
      mainly dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries. This is the place that
      Portuguese Royals would have called home. The site was chosen to be a
      royal palace thanks to its proximity to the capital of Lisbon, the
      agricultural quality of the area, and the well-stocked hunting ground.</p>

      <h2>Initiation Well&nbsp;</h2><p><br /><strong>About the well:</strong><br
      />The Initiation Well is an 8-foot-deep spiral staircase that descends
      into underground tunnels. The stone staircase is hollow in the center with
      a compass-patterned floor at the bottom. The well was never built to serve
      as a water resource and was never used as a well, it was actually built
      for secret ceremonial purposes. It is believed that the spacing of these
      landings, as well as the number of steps in between, are linked to Tarot
      mysticism and Masonic principles.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong><br
      />The Initiation Well is on the other side of the main house and near the
      edge of the estate. Once you enter the estate, you'll make a right and
      climb up a hill to get there.</p><p><strong>How to access:</strong><br
      />You can only enter from above, not from the tunnels
      below.</p><p><strong>Entrance and Rules:</strong><br />The well is so
      popular that there is a spot to queue at the top and a staff member
      manages traffic flow. There is a &ldquo;no stopping&rdquo; rule on the way
      down.</p><p><strong>Our tips:</strong><br />When we arrived at Quinta da
      Regaleira around 4 pm, we had to wait in the queue to enter the well. Once
      we entered, we made our way down slowly with hundreds of people, which
      took away from the magic.</p><p>There is no entrance to the park an hour
      before closing, which means the crowds thin out, and that's when we
      decided to go back to the well. We were surprised to find the place
      deserted.<br /><em><strong>If you can't make it here early morning for
      opening, don't worry just go an hour before they
      close.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

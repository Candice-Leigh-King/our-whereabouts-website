  title: National Palace of Sintra
  description: >-
    Let me start by saying that we didn't plan on visiting Sintra National
    Palace, we wanted to visit Monserrate Palace. Still, we accidentally
    purchased tickets to Sintra National Palace, so after grabbing lunch in the
    center of town, we decided to hop on in to take a glance at the interior of
    the palace.

      <h1><strong>History of the Palace:</strong></h1><p>The National Palace
      mainly dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries. This is the place that
      Portuguese Royals would have called home. The site was chosen to be a
      royal palace thanks to its proximity to the capital of Lisbon, the
      agricultural quality of the area, and the well-stocked hunting ground.</p>

      <h2>Why you should visit?</h2><p>&bull; Fewer crowds<br />&bull;Gardens:
      The gardens are very beautiful and are free. Opening hours: 09:30 am to
      6:30 pm.<br />&bull; Location in the Center of Sintra's old town, where
      you'll find many shops, restaurants, and authenticity. It makes it the
      perfect spot to explore after you get lunch, and it's only a 10-minute
      walk from Quinta da Regaleira<br />&bull; The view is fantastic of the
      hills and Moorish Castle.</p><h2>Our tip!</h2><p>Only visit if you are
      planning on spending two days in Sintra. It is a beautiful palace, but it
      wasn't as unique as the other Palaces and castles we visited in Sintra, so
      this was our least favorite palace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Main
      Attractions:</h2><p>&bull;The Swan Room<br />&bull;The Palatine Chapel<br
      />&bull;The Magpie Room<br />&bull;The coat of Arms Room</p>

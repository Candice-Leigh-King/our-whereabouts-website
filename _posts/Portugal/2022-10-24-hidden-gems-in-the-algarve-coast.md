It is one of the most beautiful beaches in the Algarve. There are plenty of other small beaches you can swim in the area, cool rock formations with explorable caves and tunnels. Walk a few kilometers along the marked trail towards Benagil to enjoy the view of this spectacular beach to the fullest.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Algar Seco, Lagoa:</strong></h2><p>Man-made cave with two windows, benches, and a great view of the ocean.

The beach is named after the three rocky outcrops that rise from the sea in front of it, which are known as the \"Three Brothers\" or \"Três Irmãos\" in Portuguese. One of the highlights of Praia dos Três Irmãos is the network of sea caves and rock formations that can be explored at low tide. Visitors can swim or take a boat tour to discover these natural wonders and see the beach and surrounding cliffs from a different perspective.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Church of Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Rocha, Alvor:</strong></h2><p>A small and charming white Chapel on the top of a cliff overlooking beaches from both sides.<strong> </strong>Sunrises and sunsets are magical here.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Praia da Falésia, Albufeira:</strong></h2><p>One of my favorite beaches in the Algarve, possibly even the world. The contrast between the orange cliffs, the ocean, and the green trees is mesmerizing.<br />•After you enjoy the beach don't forget to go to the top of the cliffs for a spectacular view.</p>"

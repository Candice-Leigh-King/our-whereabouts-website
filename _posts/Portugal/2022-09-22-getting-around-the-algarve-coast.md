      <h2>Car:&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to get around is in the Algarve. They
      say that driving in Portugal isn't advised, but actually, the Algarve is
      one of the easiest places to drive in Portugal. It's very convenient to
      rent a car here because you are flexible, it's the fastest way to get
      around, you are able to cover more places, parking is free and toll roads
      are cheap.</p><p><strong>If you're not planning on renting a car here are
      a few ways you can get around:</strong></p><h2>Train:&nbsp;</h2><p>The
      train is a good way to get around the Algarve but not every town has a
      train station and the train stations aren't necessarily in the center of
      the town.<br />You can order tickets<a
      href="https://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en"> from here!</a></p><p>The main
      towns that have a train are: Lagos, Portim&atilde;o, and
      Faro</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bus:&nbsp;</h2><p>There are a few buses that
      connect you to most of the towns. The main bus company in the Algarve is
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://vamus.pt/en/home-en/">Vamus Algarve</a> but most buses run
      only in the summer so make sure to check before you
      go</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Uber/Taxi:&nbsp;</h2><p>Uber is common in coastal
      towns like Albufeira, and if you&rsquo;re somewhere more remote you might
      have to wait longer.</p>

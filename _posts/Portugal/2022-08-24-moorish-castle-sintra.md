      <h1>History of the Castle:</h1><p>Moorish Castle was occupied by the Moors
      as a defensive castle until 1147, when Alfonso Henriques, the first King
      of Portugal, conquered it. At the beginning of the 15th century the castle
      was completely abandoned and in 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused considerable
      damage to the castle.</p><p>In 1840 King Ferdinand II of Portugal took up
      the task of conserving and improving the condition of the castle, the
      castle has been continually improved on and restored ever since.</p>

      <h1>How to get there:</h1><p>If you're coming from Pena Palace, it's a
      10-minute walk downhill or take the 434 bus from the train station of
      Sintra.</p><h1>Tickets:</h1><p>It's best to buy tickets online to save
      time waiting in line, however, If you don't, there are a few electronic
      ticket booths.</p><h1>Parking:</h1><p>There are a few parking lots nearby,
      but they get full pretty quickly, so if you're driving, arrive
      early.</p><h1>Food:</h1><p>There is a little cafe near the entrance with
      drinks, snacks and sandwiches.</p><h1>Restrooms:</h1><p>Right next to the
      cafe you'll find the restroom.</p><h1>Acessibility:</h1><p>Manual
      wheelchairs with folding chassis are available <strong><em>upon
      reservation</em></strong>, as well as a traction equipment adaptable to
      the vast majority of manual wheelchairs. This allows, with less effort and
      greater speed, to go through the routes.</p>

      <h1>Why you should visit:</h1><p>&bull;Organised tour groups of Sintra
      don&rsquo;t stop here as frequently as the other palaces, so it&rsquo;s
      less crowded.<br />&bull; Close to Pena palace.<br />&bull; The view is
      fantastic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our tips:</h1><p>&bull;Wear comfortable
      shoes! There are some very steep sections at the Moorish Castle when
      walking up steps to climb the castle walls. The climb isn't easy, but it
      is manageable.<br />&bull;Bring a hat and water - there isn't much shade
      here, and it can get hot, especially in the summer.</p>

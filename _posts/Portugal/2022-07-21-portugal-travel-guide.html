      <p>Portugal is such a great country to visit and has so much to offer.
      It's a great destination for a road trip because the country is so diverse
      and it is cheap, and it's safe. It has white sandy beaches with dramatic
      rock formations, beautiful cities, and great food and wine.<br />In this
      post, I cover when to visit, how long to stay, driving, how much we spent,
      and some of our tips.</p>

      <h2>WHEN TO VISIT:</h2><p>&bull;Peak Season is June to September so best
      to avoid these months because Portugal is a very popular summer
      destination and streets, beaches, and historical sites will be busy and
      prices will increase by around 40%.</p><p>&bull;The best time to visit
      Portugal is March-May and September-October when the weather is warm,
      prices are lower and many of the crowds have
      gone.</p><p>&bull;November-February is the rainy season so do know that a
      lot of resorts shut down for winter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

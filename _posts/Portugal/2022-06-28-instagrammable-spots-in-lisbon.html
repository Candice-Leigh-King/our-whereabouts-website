      <p><strong>The Algarve coast, located in southern Portugal, is a paradise
      for beach lovers and surfers, but did you know that there are also really

      <h1><strong>Miradouro de Santa Luzia</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This
      romantic terrace is located by the church of Santa Luzia and provides a
      beautiful view of Alfama district with a view over its houses, churches,
      and the Tagus River.<br />The best time to visit this beautiful viewpoint
      is during sunset. Sunrises here aren't the greatest time to visit for
      photography but are definitely beautiful and less crowded.</p>

      <h1>Carvoeiro Boardwalk and Algar Seco</h1><ul><li>Region: Lagoa, South
      Coast</li><li>Distance: 1km</li><li>Average duration: 1h</li></ul><p>You
      can extend the Seven Hanging Valleys hike by walking further to the Algar
      Seco caves and Carvoeiro Boardwalk. If you're too tired you can always
      drive to Algar Seco and Carvoeiro Boardwalk by car.&nbsp; They are both
      amazing places to explore.</p>

      <h1>Ponta da Piedade</h1><ul><li>Region: Lagos, South
      Coast</li><li>Distance: 6km round trip</li><li>Average duration:
      2h</li></ul><p>Ponta da Piedade is a great headland with unique rock
      formations, and arches sculpted by wind and waves over thousands of years.
      While here, don't miss visiting the picturesque cove at the base of Ponta
      da Piedade, which can be accessed via a set of stairs. You can take a boat
      or a kayak tour to get a closer look at all the arches and grottoes.</p>

      <h1>Trail of Headlands&nbsp;</h1><ul><li><strong>Trailhead:</strong> Praia
      dos Caneiros or Praia do Carvoeiro</li><li><strong>Distance</strong>: 6
      km.</li><li><b>Duration</b>: 2 hours.</li></ul><p>The trail of the
      headlands is a great alternative to the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail.
      It&rsquo;s not as known, so there are fewer people on the trail. You can
      do it either back &amp; forth which would be 12km or you can do it only
      one way 6 km and then get a taxi/uber back to the starting point of the
      hike. The trail affords you spectacular views of cliffs and hidden
      coves.</p>

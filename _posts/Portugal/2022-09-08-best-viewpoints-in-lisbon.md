      <p><strong>1. Elevador de Santa Justa</strong><br />The Santa Justa Lift,
      also called Carmo Lift, is an elevator. It is situated at the end of Rua
      de Santa Justa, and it connects the lower streets of the Baixa with the
      higher Largo do Carmo.When you arrive at the Santa Justa elevator you'll
      find a long line of people waiting to go in the elevator.The Santa Justa
      Lift itself is a tourist trap, the ride costs 5&euro;, is just a minute
      long, it's hard to enjoy the view and you've got to wait in a long
      queue.We recommend walking to the top of Santa Justa Lift to enjoy the
      view of Lisbon without wasting time and
      money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. St. George Castle</strong><br />Saint
      George's Castle is a historic castle that dates to at least the 8th
      century BC while the first fortifications built date from the 1st century
      BC. It's a very beautiful place to explore and has a spectacular view of
      the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Miradouro das Portas do
      Sol</strong><br />Not far from Miradouro de Santa Luzia, you'll find this
      beautiful viewpoint. We arrived early in the morning so the bar wasn't
      open yet and we had the place to ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.
      Miradouro de Santa Luzia</strong><br />We went to many viewpoints in
      Lisbon, &nbsp;and this is our favorite one. It has beautiful gardens and
      balcony view, and gorgeous azulejos (Portuguese and Spanish painted
      tin-glazed ceramic tilework).<br />&bull;The best is to come for sunset
      but know that it will be very crowded, that is why we advise you to visit
      in the morning when it's just as beautiful and less
      crowded.​​​​​​</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Miradouro da Senhora do
      Monte</strong><br />This viewpoint is located in a churchyard, this
      highest point in the neighborhood offers panoramic views of the city. It's
      one of the most beautiful viewpoints in the city. You can see the entire
      waterfront as well as the bridge.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Mirador de Gra&ccedil;a</strong><br />Another great
      viewpoint. This terrace offers dramatic, panoramic views of city rooftops
      &amp; the water beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Miradouro de Sao
      Pedro de Alcantara</strong><br />A great view of the city, less crowded
      and quieter.<br />&bull;Best to arrive at
      sunrise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Miradouro da Senhora do
      Monte</strong><br />Close to St. George castle is this lovely viewpoint
      above the Alfama old town. The view is amazing you can see the 25 Abril
      Bridge and the western part of town.<br />&bull;Best time to visit is for
      sunset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9. Arco da Rua Augusta</strong><br
      />The Rua Augusta Arch is a stone, triumphal arch-like, historical
      building on the Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio. It was built to
      commemorate the city's reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake.<br />Many
      don't know, but you can climb to the top of Arco da Rua Augusta for
      3&euro;, and offers a spectacular view of the city, particularly the
      plaza.</p>

      </strong>This beach is so unique with beautiful orange cliffs.<br
      />&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Day 2:</strong> Lagoa &amp;
      Carvoeiro</h2><p><strong>&bull;Sunrise at Praia da Marinha: </strong>One
      of the most popular spots in the Algarve and for a good reason. Sunsets
      here are magical.<br /><strong>&bull;Hike The Seven Hanging Valleys
      Trail:</strong> You can do it either as a 3.5-mile (5.7 km) hike, and get
      a taxi/Uber on the way back or a 7-mile (11.4 km) return hike.&nbsp;<br
      /><strong>&bull;Algar Seco: </strong>Man-made cave with two windows,
      benches, and a great view of the ocean. It is very accessible, and the
      whole area offers great views.<br /><strong>&bull;Praia do Para&iacute;so:
      </strong>Beautiful beach accessed by a series of stone steps.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Praia dos Caneiros: </strong>This beach has beautiful a
      cave, cliffs, white sand, a rooftop bar, restrooms, and a great hike. It's
      pretty small so come early.<br /><strong>&bull;Praia do Carvalho:
      </strong>Another great beach near Benagil cave. You have to walk down some
      steps through a tunnel to get to the
      beach.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Day 3:
      </strong>Alvor</h2><p><strong>&bull;Sunrise at Praia dos Tr&ecirc;s
      Irm&atilde;os:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of our favorite beaches. Tucked
      away in Portim&atilde;o, you'll find this beach with dramatic rock
      formations, pure golden sand, and clear blue water.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Explore Benagil Cave:</strong> by Kayak, boat or SUP<br
      /><strong>&bull;Ferragudo Old Town:&nbsp;</strong>The scenery in the small
      town is beautiful with pink flowers and coloful houses by the beach.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Praia Nova:</strong>&nbsp;Praia Nova is a small beach near
      Praia da Senhora da Rocha on the Atlantic coast, Porches.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Church of Igreja de Nossa Senhora da
      Rocha:&nbsp;</strong>A small and charming white Chapel on the top of a
      cliff overlooking beaches from both sides.<b> </b>Sunrises and sunsets are
      magical here.<br /><strong>&bull;Sunset at Albandeira
      Beach:</strong>&nbsp;This beach has a stunning rock formation in the shape
      of an arch. There are plenty of cool caves nearby that you can explore.
      The beach is so quiet and secluded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Day
      4:</strong> Lagos &amp; Sagres</h2><p><strong>&bull;Sunrise at Praia dos
      Estudantes:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of Lagos&rsquo;s most photographed
      beaches due to the famous Roman Bridge, which linked the mainland with
      Pinhao Fortress. It's called the Student beach because it&rsquo;s a small
      beach that can fit a class of students<br />​​​​​<strong>&bull;Praia Dona
      Ana:&nbsp;</strong>This beach has golden sand and many beautiful shells.
      It is best to come for sunrise.<br /><strong>&bull;Praia do
      Camilo:</strong>&nbsp;a very scenic beach, but quite narrow, so it gets
      busy very quickly. You can access 2 other small beaches from there. Before
      you go down to the beach, you can enjoy the view from above. It is
      stunning.<br /><strong>&bull;Ponta da Camilo: </strong>A great
      viewpoint<br /><strong>&bull;Ponta da Piedade:&nbsp;</strong>Once you
      park, you'll find a path with many steps that leads to a small platform in
      the ocean where you can rent a boat and explore caves. Walking down,
      you'll enjoy the beautiful view and natural arches. Take into
      consideration that if you come mid-day it gets very crowded and it isn't
      as magical.<br /><strong>&bull;Old Town Lagos:</strong> Explore Old Town
      Lagos, it is a charming place filled with nightlife, restaurants, and gift
      shops.<br /><strong>&bull;Sagres Fortress:&nbsp;</strong>Known as the edge
      of the world, this fortress was built to protect Portugal against the
      Moors. However, the original structure was severely damaged by the 1755
      earthquake. It's got dramatic cliffs, a small church, a maze, and
      beautiful views. I would definitely recommend visiting if you're in the
      area, however, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.<br />Entrance Fee: 3
      Euro per person<br />Duration of stay: You'll need more than an hour to
      properly stroll around and see<br /><strong>&bull;Cabo S&atilde;o Vicente:
      </strong>Considered the edge of the world, this spot is definitely worth
      visiting.</p><p><em>➟ Drive 2.5 hours from The Algarve to Lisbon</em></p>

      location to explore.<br /><strong>&bull;National Palace:&nbsp;</strong>We
      didn't plan on visiting Sintra National Palace, we wanted to visit
      Monserrate Palace. Still, we accidentally purchased tickets to Sintra

      to hop on in to take a glance at the interior of the palace.<br
      /><strong>&bull;Quinta da Regaleira:&nbsp;</strong>This Gothic palace is a
      must-visit landmark visiting Sintra and has to be our favorite palace. The
      opulent palace has spectacular gardens with a surrealistic initiation well

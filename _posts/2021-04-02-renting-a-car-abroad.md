      <p>Renting a car while traveling can be a great way to explore a new
      destination at your own pace and convenience.<br />Here are some tips to
      keep in mind when renting a car:</p>
  - _section-type: blog-textarea
    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>Booking car rental:</strong></h2><p>You should rent the car as early as possible, prices go up as you get closer to the date of travel.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Automatic vehicle VS. Manual vehicle:</strong></h2><p>It should be taken into account that an automatic vehicle costs much more than a manual vehicle, sometimes twice the amount., Yet, driving through the mountains manually is not always easy for those who are either inexperienced or uncomfortable with the manual. Take that into consideration.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Car type:</strong></h2><p>You do not necessarily get the car you order but of a similar class. What do I mean? For example, we ordered a FIAT PANDA but we got a DACIA, a set of similar vehicles of the same size but it is not the car we ordered. That's how it is at car rental agencies.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Pay attention to the car insurance you do:</strong></h2><p>It is important that you have insurance to cancel the deductible - either when you sign the rental forms or when you do travel insurance abroad because it can sometimes cost a lot of money.</p><p>Pay attention to the exact times you take the vehicle and return it because they can charge you extra money.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Gas:</strong></h2><p>Make sure to demand to return the car with a <strong>full fuel tank</strong>, because the rental company will charge you a lot of money for the fuel if they fill it up.<strong> You better do it</strong>.</p><p>\_</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Photograph the car:</strong></h2><p>When you receive the car, photograph it, and videotape it, from all angles. Pay attention to</p><p>any scratches, dents, or anything out of the ordinary. Immediately and tell the agent dealing with the vehicle. Taking both videos and photos is for your proof, otherwise the insurance company can blame you for things you did not do thereby charging you for damages.</p><p>Before driving off with your rental, inspect the trunk/boot for your emergency kit in case of a puncture - tire jack, tire iron that fits the lug nuts, spare tire with air in it, to replace a wheel</p><p>\_</p><p>In addition, make sure that you know how to <strong>operate the vehicle so slide into the drivers seat and test all car controls . </strong>It sounds silly but you will thank me in your heart. Driving an unfamiliar car is already a distraction, therefore you should make sure you’re all set and ready to focus on the road. Last but not least, know which fuel your car rental requires</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Drivers License:</strong></h2><p>Please note that you are to bring a valid driving license or an international license. Please note that you <strong>must</strong> have the credit card with which you made the booking of the vehicle otherwise it can cause you problems.</p>"

      <p>In this blog I will talk about things to know before your trip, the

      <h2>Best time to visit</h2><p>The best time is in the shoulder season,
      which is <strong>April-May</strong> and
      <strong>September-October.</strong> During these months the weather is
      still warm enough and you'll be able to beat the summer
      crowds.</p><p>Depending on the year, there may still be snow in May and it
      might start snowing as early as September, so do check the weather before
      you go.</p><p>Be aware that during the winter season some of the mountains
      in the Dolomites are used as ski slopes.</p>

      <h2>Where to stay</h2><p>The Dolomites is located across three Northern
      Italian regions and five Italian provinces. Those three regions are
      Veneto, Trentino Alto-Adige/S&uuml;dtirol, and Friuli Venezia Giulia. It
      is an enormous alpine area and trying to decide where to stay can be a
      little overwhelming.</p><p>When trying to decide where to stay, ask
      yourself what are the hikes/sites you would like to see and how many days
      will you be staying in the Dolomites.</p><p>The popular locations aren't
      near each other therefore there are a few options on where to
      stay:</p><p>Stay in different areas and move every night
      -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> you'll be near the
      attractions,</p><ul><li><strong>Cons:</strong> It's pretty tiring to move
      from one hotel to another, every night.</li><li>Stay in 2 different areas
      - It&rsquo;s far better to <strong>choose two</strong>, where you can
      divide your time equally.</li><li>Base yourself in one area but expect to
      do a lot of driving. That is what we did.</li></ul>

      <h3>1. Val Gardena, South Tyrol</h3><p>There are three towns in Val
      Gardena/Grodnertal: Ortisei, Santa Cristina, and Selva di Val
      Gardena.</p><p>This is where we stayed and here are a few reasons
      why:</p><ul><li>Free public transit card: When sleeping anywhere in Val
      Gardena you're given a free public transit card. This transit card means
      you can get to various trailheads without having to worry about driving
      and paying for parking.</li><li>There are many
      restaurants.</li><li>Attractions nearby: From Val Gardena, you can easily
      reach the <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di
      Siusi</strong> (Seiser Alm). <strong>Lago di Carezza</strong> can also be
      reached within an hour from here.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>2. Val di
      Funes, South Tyrol</h3><p>Val di Funes, aka Villn&ouml;ss, is a must-see
      while visiting the Dolomites. This valley is perfect for those looking for
      a beautiful view of the dramatic Geisler/Odle peaks and peaceful, offbeat
      region.</p><ul><li>There are many great hikes around the
      area.</li><li>Attractions nearby: From Val di Funes you can reach the
      <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di Siusi</strong>
      (Seiser Alm) within 40 minutes.</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong> Don't
      expect there to be many restaurants here, there isn't much in Val di Funes
      besides nature.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3. Alpe di Siusi, South
      Tyrol</h3><p>Alpe di Siusi is a magical place to be for sunrise or sunset,
      but this can be a bit complicated to reach if you are unaware of the
      rules.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to drive up the roads are closed
      between 9 am to 5 pm. You can drive up to Compatsch before and after these
      hours. It's about an hour's walk to the most picturesque part of Alpe di
      Siusi. The cable car starts working at 8 am.</p><p>The best way to
      actually witness the sunset or sunrise with the least effort is staying at
      a hotel on the mountain.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;4. Bolzano, Trentino
      Alto-Adige</h3><p>It's a big city in Trentino which is tucked away in the
      Italian Alps. Here you will find stunning old churches and ancient
      castles.</p><ul><li><strong>Easily reachable</strong> by car and public
      transportation.</li><li>Attractions nearby: From Bolzano, you can reach
      the <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di
      Siusi</strong> (Seiser Alm) within an hour.</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong>
      Not central in the Dolomites</li></ul><h3>5. Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo,
      Belluno</h3><p>It's a big town, considered the <strong>heart</strong> of
      the Southern Alps. It's filled with restaurants, shopping, museums, bars,
      and nightlife.</p><ul><li>Some of the best nearby day hikes include
      <strong>Lago di Sorapis, Tre Cime di Lavaredo,</strong>
      <strong>Misurina,</strong> and a walk around the famous <strong>Lago di
      Braies</strong>.</li><li>It's <strong>accessible </strong>by car and
      public transportation.</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong> It is further away
      from sites like Lake Braies, Alpe di Siusi, and Lago di Carezza.</li></ul>

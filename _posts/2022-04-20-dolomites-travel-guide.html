      <h2>Best time to visit:</h2><p>The best time is in the shoulder season,
      which is <strong>April-May</strong> and
      <strong>September-October.</strong> During these months the weather is
      still warm enough and you'll be able to beat the summer
      crowds.</p><p>Depending on the year, there may still be snow in May and it
      might start snowing as early as September, so do check the weather before
      you go.</p><p>Be aware that during the winter season some of the mountains
      in the Dolomites are used as ski slopes.</p>

      <h2><strong>Where to stay:</strong></h2><p>The Dolomites is located across
      three Northern Italian regions and five Italian provinces. Those three
      regions are Veneto, Trentino Alto-Adige/S&uuml;dtirol, and Friuli Venezia
      Giulia. It is an enormous alpine area and trying to decide where to stay
      can be a little overwhelming.</p><p>When trying to decide where to stay,
      ask yourself what are the hikes/sites you would like to see and how many
      days will you be staying in the Dolomites.</p><p>The popular locations
      aren't near each other therefore there are a few options on where to
      stay:</p><p>Stay in different areas and move every night
      -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> you'll be near the
      attractions,</p><ul><li><strong>Cons:</strong> It's pretty tiring to move
      from one hotel to another, every night.</li><li>Stay in 2 different areas
      - It&rsquo;s far better to <strong>choose two</strong>, where you can
      divide your time equally.</li><li>Base yourself in one area but expect to
      do a lot of driving. That is what we did.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>4. HOW IT WAS FORMED</strong></p><p>About 60 million years ago,
      a series of earth movements pushed the seabed upwards, creating a high
      plateau and causing many vertical fault lines in the thick layer of
      sandstone.</p><p>The rocks are made from sandstone and conglomerate
      rocks.</p>

      hundreds of antiquity sites. <strong>It is illegal to own, buy, sell or
      excavate antiquities</strong>, and items found accidentally must be handed
      over to authorities.</p>

      bring a scarf and wrap it around your waist but if you don't have one
      don't worry, in some monasteries, they have skirts you could take at the
      entrance to monasteries, but some will make you buy a scarf for 6 EURO if
      you don't have a scarf or sweater to wrap around.</p>

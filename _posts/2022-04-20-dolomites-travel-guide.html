      <h2>Best time to visit</h2><p>The best time is in the shoulder season,
      which is <strong>April-May</strong> and
      <strong>September-October.</strong> During these months the weather is
      still warm enough and you'll be able to beat the summer
      crowds.</p><p>Depending on the year, there may still be snow in May and it
      might start snowing as early as September, so do check the weather before
      you go.</p><p>Be aware that during the winter season some of the mountains
      in the Dolomites are used as ski slopes.</p>

      <h2>Where to stay</h2><p>The Dolomites is located across three Northern
      Italian regions and five Italian provinces. Those three regions are
      Veneto, Trentino Alto-Adige/S&uuml;dtirol, and Friuli Venezia Giulia. It
      is an enormous alpine area and trying to decide where to stay can be a
      little overwhelming.</p><p>When trying to decide where to stay, ask
      yourself what are the hikes/sites you would like to see and how many days
      will you be staying in the Dolomites.</p><p>The popular locations aren't
      near each other therefore there are a few options on where to
      stay</p><p>Stay in different areas and move every night
      -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros</strong> you'll be near the
      attractions,</p><ul><li><strong>Cons</strong> It's pretty tiring to move
      from one hotel to another, every night.</li><li>Stay in 2 different areas
      - It&rsquo;s far better to <strong>choose two</strong>, where you can
      divide your time equally.</li><li>Base yourself in one area but expect to
      do a lot of driving. That is what we did.</li></ul>

      <h3>1. Val Gardena, South Tyrol</h3><p>There are three towns in Val
      Gardena/Grodnertal Ortisei, Santa Cristina, and Selva di Val
      Gardena.</p><p>This is where we stayed and here are a few reasons
      why</p><ul><li>Free public transit card When sleeping anywhere in Val
      Gardena you're given a free public transit card. This transit card means
      you can get to various trailheads without having to worry about driving
      and paying for parking.</li><li>There are many
      restaurants.</li><li>Attractions nearby From Val Gardena, you can easily
      reach the <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di
      Siusi</strong> (Seiser Alm). <strong>Lago di Carezza</strong> can also be
      reached within an hour from here.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>2. Val di
      Funes, South Tyrol</h3><p>Val di Funes, aka Villn&ouml;ss, is a must-see
      while visiting the Dolomites. This valley is perfect for those looking for
      a beautiful view of the dramatic Geisler/Odle peaks and peaceful, offbeat
      region.</p><ul><li>There are many great hikes around the
      area.</li><li>Attractions nearby From Val di Funes you can reach the
      <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di Siusi</strong>
      (Seiser Alm) within 40 minutes.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong> Don't expect
      there to be many restaurants here, there isn't much in Val di Funes
      besides nature.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3. Alpe di Siusi, South
      Tyrol</h3><p>Alpe di Siusi is a magical place to be for sunrise or sunset,
      but this can be a bit complicated to reach if you are unaware of the
      rules.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to drive up the roads are closed
      between 9 am to 5 pm. You can drive up to Compatsch before and after these
      hours. It's about an hour's walk to the most picturesque part of Alpe di
      Siusi. The cable car starts working at 8 am.</p><p>The best way to
      actually witness the sunset or sunrise with the least effort is staying at
      a hotel on the mountain.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;4. Bolzano, Trentino
      Alto-Adige</h3><p>It's a big city in Trentino which is tucked away in the
      Italian Alps. Here you will find stunning old churches and ancient
      castles.</p><ul><li><strong>Easily reachable</strong> by car and public
      transportation.</li><li>Attractions nearby From Bolzano, you can reach the
      <strong>Seceda, Val di Funes,</strong> and <strong>Alpe di Siusi</strong>
      (Seiser Alm) within an hour.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong> Not central in
      the Dolomites</li></ul><h3>5. Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo, Belluno</h3><p>It's
      a big town, considered the <strong>heart</strong> of the Southern Alps.
      It's filled with restaurants, shopping, museums, bars, and
      nightlife.</p><ul><li>Some of the best nearby day hikes include
      <strong>Lago di Sorapis, Tre Cime di Lavaredo,</strong>
      <strong>Misurina,</strong> and a walk around the famous <strong>Lago di
      Braies</strong>.</li><li>It's <strong>accessible </strong>by car and
      public transportation.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong> It is further away
      from sites like Lake Braies, Alpe di Siusi, and Lago di Carezza.</li></ul>

      <h2>Things to know before your trip</h2><h3>1. Language</h3><p>In the
      Dolomites, most places have two different names, because a large area of
      the Dolomites is located in a region that was part of the Austro-Hungarian
      Empire until WWI when it officially became part of Italy. For this reason,
      until today, most places in the region of Alto Adige (in Italian) / South
      Tyrol (in German) have two different names, one in each
      language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. South Tyrolians</h3><p>Those who live in
      South Tyrol don't consider themselves Italian nor German, They Prefer to
      be called South Tyrolians. If you call them German or Italian, they may
      find it offensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Rent a car</h3><p>The best way
      to get around in the Dolomites is by car! Getting around by public
      transportation isn't easy in the Dolomites and if you truly want to
      experience this area to its fullest you need to rent a
      car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Weather</h3><p>The Dolomite Mountains offer
      some of the best weather in all of the Alps, perfect for year-round.
      Saying that it is important to <strong>always</strong> check the forecast
      beforehand and don&rsquo;t underestimate the weather.&nbsp; Take into
      consideration that the valleys will be warmer while the mountains will get
      colder and could get very foggy.</p><ul><li>Summer (June-September): Warm
      temperatures and plenty of sun which is perfect for any activity. While
      the average maximum temperature may reach some 25 degrees Celsius, there
      is a nice breeze.</li><li>Fall (September-November): The temperature
      drops, but weather conditions remain stable and pleasant.</li><li>Winter
      (December-March): Snow usually begins to accumulate during these months
      and is very popular for those looking to do winter sports.</li><li>Spring
      (April-May): During these months it gets warmer, but it also rains. It's a
      great time to visit since the spring brings beautiful green valleys and
      pastures overflowing with wildflowers.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>5.
      Gear</h3><p>Hiking in the Dolomites can be challenging, even the most
      experienced hiker may find the hikes there challenging. Don&rsquo;t
      underestimate the importance of good and sturdy hiking boots. Hiking
      sticks can also come in handy since some of the trails are narrow, have
      small slippery rocks, and have sheer drops with nowhere to hold
      unto.</p><p>Also, since the weather is unpredictable, I would use the
      onion layer method (layered outfits are your best
      friend).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Avoid crowds</h3><p>The Dolomites has
      become famous over the years (thanks to social media), therefore expect
      crowds even during the early mornings. Wake up as early as possible so you
      can really enjoy the beautiful nature without
      crowds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Best time for photography</h3><p>There is
      something about the sunsets/sunrises in the Alps, they are almost pink. If
      you are looking to capture beautiful photos in the Dolomites, aim for
      sunrise and sunsets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8. Carry small change</h3><p>The
      Dolomites has small villages and most places don't accept credit cards,
      <strong>cash only</strong>.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>9. Expenses</h3><p>Italy
      isn't the cheapest destination, the Dolomites is no exception. If you take
      our Venice from the exception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>EXPENSES:&nbsp;
      2,016$ (6,363 NIS).</strong></h3><p><strong>Flights:</strong> From
      Tel-Aviv to Venice, it cost us 243 USD for both of us, including a
      suitcase.</p><p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> 482.5 USD for 3 nights in
      a 4-star hotel.</p><p><strong>Car rental:</strong> 315.7
      USD.</p><p><strong>Gas:</strong> 106 USD.</p><p><strong>Travel
      Insurance:</strong> 122.8 USD.</p><p><strong>Covid-19 tests:</strong>
      324.6 USD.</p><p><strong>Food:</strong>&nbsp; 160
      USD.</p><p><strong>Activities:</strong> 322.5 USD.</p>

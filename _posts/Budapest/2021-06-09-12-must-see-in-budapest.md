      <h2><strong>VAJDAHUNYAD CASTLE:</strong></h2><p>This castle is located in
      the City Park of Budapest. It is a copy of Hunyad Castle, known as Corvin
      Castle, in Hunedoara, Romania. It was built in 1896 as part of the
      Millennial Exhibition which celebrated the 1,000 years of Hungary since
      the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895.<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 1,100 Forint. (3.5
      USD).</p><h2><strong>HEROES SQUARE:</strong></h2><p>This is the city's
      largest square, noted for its iconic Millennium monument with statues
      featuring the seven chieftains of the Magyars and other important
      Hungarian national leaders. The square is surrounded by museums and
      monuments and is not too far from Vajdahunyad castle and Szechenyi
      Baths.</p><h2><strong>SZECHENYI BATHS:</strong></h2><p>The first
      19th-century thermal bath in Budapest. It is one of the largest public
      baths in Europe and resembles a neo-Baroque palace rather than a bath.<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>1,700 Forint includes an entrance and a
      locker big enough to fit a big backpack, coats, and boots. Take your time
      to relax and really enjoy all these
      pools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>BUDA PALACE:</strong></h2><p>This is
      one of the best views in Budapest. Buda Castle is the historical castle
      and palace complex of the Hungarian kings in Budapest. It was first
      completed in 1265, but the massive Baroque palace today occupying most of
      the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The complex in the past was
      referred to as either the Royal Palace or the Royal
      Castle.</p><h2><strong>DOHANY STREET SYNAGOGUE:</strong></h2><p>The
      largest synagogue in Europe (2nd to largest in the world!!) This synagogue
      is gorgeous It's a very unique synagogue.<br /><strong>Entrance
      fee:</strong> 4,000 Forint (12 USD) and includes a free tour that I highly
      recommend.<br /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Sunday-Thursday
      10:00-16:00<br />Friday 10:00-14:00</p><h2><strong>MARGARET
      ISLAND:</strong></h2><p>It is a small island in the middle of the Danube
      in central Budapest. The island is mostly covered by landscape parks and
      is a popular recreational area. Its medieval ruins are reminders of its
      importance in the Middle Ages as a religious center. Before the 14th
      century, the island was called the <em>Insula leporum</em> (Island of
      Rabbits).</p>

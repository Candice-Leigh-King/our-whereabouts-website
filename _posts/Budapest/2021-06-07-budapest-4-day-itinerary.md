      <h2><strong>DAY 1 - ARRIVAL:</strong></h2><h2>Shopping in Deak Ferenc
      &amp; Danube River Boat Tour:</h2><p>Most of the attractions are bunched
      up together, making it easy to see the city in just a few days. We arrived
      in Budapest Sunday late afternoon, so we walked around Deak Ferenc street
      and did some shopping.</p><h3>Deak Ferenc Street:</h3><p>We did some
      shopping. The prices are so much cheaper than in Israel, so we had some
      fun in H&amp;M, Tommy Hilfiger, Zara, COS, Lush (A great soup and creams
      store), and more.</p><h3>Danube River Boat Tour:</h3><p>Highly recommended
      to do so at night! The parliament, Buda Castle, and Fisherman's Bastion
      are all lit up. The boat tour is 25 euros (100 shekels), and it includes
      an hour and a half boat tour around the Danube river, a guide about the
      history of Budapest, and champagne/beer/soft drink for your
      choosing.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 2 - PEST SIDE:</strong></h2><h2>Chian
      Bridge, Shoes on the Danube memorial, Parliament and St. Stephan
      Basilica.&nbsp;</h2><h3>Chain Bridge:</h3><p>On the side of the hotel (D8,
      intercontinental, and the four seasons) that is the side of Pest. The
      other side of the bridge is Buda.</p><h3>Shoes on the Danube
      memorial:</h3><p>Once you get to the Chain Bridge, you make a right and
      continue walking straight on the river. as you walk on the river towards
      the parliament you can see the shoe memorial in memory of the Jews that
      were murdered and bodies were dropped in the river in
      1944-1945.</p><h3>Hungarian Parliament Building:</h3><p>Inspired by the
      British parliament building, with gothic, baroque and Renaissance elements
      it's the 3rd largest Parliament in Europe.<br /><strong>Entrance
      Fee:</strong> 2,200 Forint (7 USD).<br /><strong>Opening hours:</strong>
      Monday-Friday 8:00-18:00.<br />Saturday-Sunday 8:00-16:00.<br
      /><strong>Guards ceremony: </strong>Every round hour, there's a guard
      change ceremony at the entrance.</p><h3>St. Stephan Basilica:</h3><p>We
      took a bus (7,15 or M2) 10-minute bus ride. or a 12-minute walk. It is one
      of Budapest's greatest landmarks, built in 1906 and took 50 years to
      build. The design was based on drawings by Jozsef Hild.<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free, but it&rsquo;s customary to pay 200
      Forint. (0.6 USD)<br /><strong>Opening Hours: </strong>Monday-Friday
      9:00-17:00<br />Saturday 9:00-13:00, Sunday 13:00-17:00<br
      />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr. Funk</strong></p><p>4-minute walk from St.
      Stephan Basilica there is Mr. Funk donuts! Highly recommend they have
      unique donuts!!!!</p>

      <h2><strong>DAY 3 - BUDA SIDE:</strong></h2><h2>Buda Palace, Fisherman's
      Bastion, Matthias Church and Dohany Street Synagogue</h2><h3>Buda
      Palace:</h3><p>&nbsp;This is one of the best views in Budapest. Buda
      Castle is Budapest's historical castle and palace complex of the Hungarian
      kings. It was first completed in 1265, but the massive Baroque palace
      today occupying most of the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The
      complex in the past was referred to as either the Royal Palace or the
      Royal Castle.</p><h3>National Gallery:</h3><p>The museum also has a small
      collection of works by big-name artists like Raphael, El Greco, Frans
      Hals, and Monet.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>1,800 Forint (6
      USD).<br /><strong>Opening hours:&nbsp;</strong>Tue-Sun
      10am-6pm</p><h3>Fisherman's Bastion:</h3><p>Supposedly named for the
      fishermen responsible for defending this stretch of the bank against
      invaders in the Middle Ages. This beautiful spot you can not miss makes
      you feel like a princess in a castle with a gorgeous view of Pest.<br
      /><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>Free.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:&nbsp;</strong>All day.</p><h3>Matthias Church:</h3><p>The church of
      the Assumption of the Buda castle is a Roman Catholic church located in
      the Holy Trinity Square in front of the Fisherman's Bastion at the heart
      of Buda's Castle District. It was Originally built in 1255 it is a
      beautiful church with a gorgeous roof with many colors.<br
      /><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> 1,500 forint (5 USD)<br /><strong>Opening
      Hours: </strong>Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00.<br />Saturday 9:00-13:00, Sunday
      13:00-17:00</p><h3>Dohany Street Synagogue:</h3><p>The largest synagogue
      in Europe (2nd to largest in the world!!) This synagogue is mind-blowing.
      It's a unique synagogue.<br /><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> 4,000 Forint
      (12 USD) and includes a free tour that I highly recommend.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Sunday-Thursday 10:00-16:00.<br />Friday
      10:00-14:00</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DAY 4 - CENTER OF
      BUDAPEST:</strong></h2><h2>Vajdahunyad Castle, Heroes Square, and
      Szechenyi Baths:</h2><p>We woke up and took the M1 To Sz&eacute;chenyi
      f&uuml;rdő (It's a 10-minute ride)</p><h3>Vajdahunyad Castle:</h3><p>This
      castle is located in the City Park of Budapest. It is a copy of Hunyad
      Castle, known as Corvin Castle, in Hunedoara, Romania. It was built in
      1896 as part of the Millennial Exhibition, which celebrated the 1,000
      years of Hungary since the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in
      895.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 1,100 Forint. (3.5
      USD).</p><h3>Varosliget Cafe &amp; Restaurant:&nbsp;</h3><p>If you want to
      have lunch this is a great place with good food and a beautiful view of
      the castle.</p><h3>Heroes Square:&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;This is the city's
      largest square, noted for its iconic Millennium monument with statues
      featuring the seven chieftains of the Magyars and other influential
      Hungarian national leaders. The square is surrounded by museums and
      monuments and is not far from Vajdahunyad castle and Szechenyi
      Baths.</p><h3>Szechenyi Baths:</h3><p>The first 19th-century thermal bath
      in Budapest. It is one of the largest public baths in Europe and resembles
      a neo-Baroque palace rather than a bath. 1,700 Forint includes an entrance
      and a locker big enough to fit a big backpack, coats, and everything. Take
      your time to relax and enjoy all these pools.</p>

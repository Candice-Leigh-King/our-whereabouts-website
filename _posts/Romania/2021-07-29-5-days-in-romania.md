      <h2><strong>DAY 1 -</strong></h2><h2><strong>Arrival, Mega Mall &amp;
      Therme Spa</strong></h2><h2>Arrival:</h2><p>We landed in Bucharest at
      12:30 pm. When you arrive, you turn to the left and take a piece of paper
      from the Yellow taxi machine, and the driver arrives after a few
      minutes.<br />It cost 45 Lei (10.9$) for the taxi.</p><h2>Mega
      Mall:</h2><p>Shopping in Romania is cheap, so we decided to go on a
      shopping spree. We decided to go to Megamall since we heard great things
      about it, and it did not disappoint. The mall has got four floors with all
      the great international brands. The mall also has a cinema city and many
      restaurants.</p><h2>Therme Spa:</h2><p>The biggest spa in Europe. It's the
      main attraction in Bucharest.<br /><strong>Things you need to know about
      Therme spa: </strong><br />1. Bring flip-flops in your bag! NOT ON
      YOU!&nbsp;<br />2. Bring your swimsuit in your bag! NOT ON YOU!&nbsp;<br
      />3. Bring a towel (has to be a light color).<br />4. Anything not made
      out of swimsuit material will not be allowed in the pools.&nbsp;<br />5.
      Photos are not allowed, but you could sneak a few photos here and
      there.</p>

      <p>Day 2 and 3 we took day tours from Bucharest.</p><h2><strong>DAY 2 -<br
      />Jeep Tour to Carpathian Villages and
      snowmobiles:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a
      href="http://www.vladi-romania.simplesite.com/">Vladi</a> is a Romanian
      tour guide that lives in Bucharest. He is highly recommended and offers a
      variety of tours around Romania. When we were trying to decide which tour
      we wanted to do with him, we had a difficult time choosing which tour to
      take. I spoke to Vladi on Whatsapp he was very patient and explained about
      all his tours After hearing everything he had to offer, we talked between
      ourselves to see what suits us best and ended up booking two private tours
      with Vladi. The jeep tour to the Carpathian villages and snowmobiles cost
      105&euro; (If you want to do the tour without the snowmobiles, it costs
      75&euro;).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Doftana Valley &amp; Doftana
      River:</h2><p>Valea Doftanei is a commune in Prahova County, Romania. It
      is composed of two villages: Teșila and Trăisteni.<br />The river is 51km
      long, and its basin size is 410 km.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Barajul Paltinu
      Dam:</h2><p>The Paltinu Dam is located near the city of C&acirc;mpina, on
      the Doftana river valley, downstream of its confluence with the Păltinoasa
      valley, in the gorges known as &lsquo;&rsquo;La Tocile&rsquo;&rsquo;. The
      dam has a height of 108m above the foundation, the upside of the dam being
      654 mdm.&nbsp; The total length of the upside of the dam is 455
      m.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Poiana Ciucas Baraj Paltinu:</h2><p>The viewpoint
      of the Doftana River.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Secaria Family
      Village:</h2><p>Vladi took us to an authentic Romanian home. Helena lives
      a simple life with cows, horses, sheep, and pigs. She is such a warm,
      welcoming person and although we didn't understand everything she said we
      enjoyed her company so much!</p><h2>Azuga - Snowmobiling:</h2><p>The
      snowmobile was a fantastic experience. We were so lucky because it started
      snowing as we went on the snowmobiles and it was just magical. Make sure
      that if you go during the winter time wear SUPER WARM gloves! Our hands
      felt like they froze it was freezing, we even heard of some people who got
      frostbite, but we came prepared.</p><h2><strong>DAY 3 -<br />Trip to Peles
      Castle, Bran's Castle and Sinaia:</strong></h2><p>We booked a private tour
      with Vladi. It was 55 Euro per person.<br />There was a horrible storm
      five days before our trip, so the cable car in Sinaia was only opening at
      12 PM, so Vladi took us to Bran's castle first.</p><h2>Bran's
      Castle:</h2><p>In 1957, a museum was opened in the castle. The castle,
      shown to tourists as "Dracula Castle," has very little connection to the
      influential Vlad (and it is unknown whether he stayed there himself). The
      castle was famous mainly for Bram Stoker's novel, "Count Dracula." If you
      go there knowing it has nothing to do with Dracula, then you can enjoy
      this place. But if you think it's all about Dracula in there, you will be
      disappointed.<br />&bull;<strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 40 LEI (9 USD).<br
      />&bull;<strong>Opening hours:</strong> Tuesday- Sunday 9 AM-4 PM. Mondays
      from 12 PM to 4 PM.</p><h2>Gondola Sinaia:</h2><p>Sinaia Cable car that
      goes up to 1,400 meters high. Sadly the 2,000 meters was still closed
      because of bad weather, even though they said they would open it at 12
      PM.<br />&bull;<strong>Entrance Fee:&nbsp;</strong>35 RON (7.94 USD) per
      person per person<br />&bull;<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00 AM -
      6:00 PM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Peles Castle:</h2><p>This is the <strong>most
      beautiful castle we've been to in Romania</strong>, yet most people tend
      to skip going inside this beautiful castle. Peleș Castle is a
      Neo-Renaissance castle in the Carpathian Mountains, near Sinaia, in
      Prahova County, Romania, on an existing medieval route linking
      Transylvania and Wallachia, built between 1873 and 1914. Its inauguration
      was held in 1883. It was constructed for King Carol I.<br
      />&bull;<strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 30 LEI per person<br
      />&bull;<strong>Camera Fee:&nbsp;</strong>40 LEI. We paid for one camera
      to take photos inside.<br />&bull;<strong>Opening hours:</strong>
      Wednesday-Sunday 9:15AM - 5:00 PM (Closed on Mons-Tues)</p>

      <h2><strong>DAY 4 -&nbsp;<br />Bucharest:</strong></h2><p>We started our
      day at 9 AM and decided to see what Bucharest has to offer.</p><h2>Coral
      Temple:&nbsp;</h2><p>This temple is a copy of Vienna's
      Leopoldstadt-Tempelgasse Great Synagogue, which was raised in 1855-1858.
      It was designed by Enderle and Freiwald and built between 1864 - 1866. The
      synagogue was devastated by the far-right Legionaries but was then
      restored after World War II in 1945. The main hall was recently
      refurbished and re-opened in 2015. We enjoyed our tour with Naomi.<br
      />​​​​​<strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 15 Lei (3.20 USD).<br
      /><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Monday - Thursday 9:00 - 15:00. On Sat
      &amp; Sun it is closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Carturesti
      Carusel:</h2><p>Carturesti Carusel is a bookstore on <strong>Lipscani 55
      Street</strong> in the old town of Bucharest. It belongs to the Romanian
      bookstore chain Cărtureşti, and it's one of the most fantastic books
      stores. It's got booked, games, and even a gorgeous
      cafe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Stroll around the Center of
      Town:</strong></h2><p>Just absorb this beautiful city. There is great
      architecture on every corner.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Savings Bank&rsquo;s
      Palace:</strong> This building doesn't look like a savings bank, but it
      was originally CEC Savings Bank headquarters built in 1900. CEC is the
      oldest Romanian bank. The construction of a home worthy of its importance
      started in 1897, and King Carol I himself laid the cornerstone of the new
      building. The architect who designed the grandiose palace, Paul Gottereau,
      is one of the French architects active in the Kingdom of Romania in the
      late 19th century -he also designed the Carol I Royal Foundation&rsquo;s
      building, today it is still CEC bank headquarters, although the building
      has been sold to the municipality of Bucharest for an eventual
      museum.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Stavropoleus monastery</strong>: Probably the
      most visited in Bucharest, the lovely Stavropoleos Monastery Church is a
      must if you&rsquo;d like to explore one of the most remarkable religious
      monuments in the capital. Monastery has a rich collection of rare icons,
      iconoclastic objects, and old history and religious books. To visit the
      monastery's museum, <strong>you need to reserve a spot in
      advance.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Cismigiu Gardens:</h2><p>Located in
      the center of Bucharest is Cismigiu Gardens. It is Bucharest's first
      public garden opened back in 1854, and it is a great location to relax
      after all that walking and have a picnic. The park's design was inspired
      by English gardens, and it features playgrounds, green meadows, and
      gazebos that host live concerts in the summer. There is a lake in the
      middle of the parks that you can skate on during the winter.</p><h2>Piata
      Univeritatti:</h2><p>Facing the University of Bucharest, there are four
      statues of Romanian heroes and personalities standing in the square: Ion
      Heliada Radulso, Michael the Brave, Gyorga Lazar, and Spyro Harte. Also
      located around the square are several buildings of the university, the Ion
      Luca Carajiela National Theater, and the Intercontinental
      Hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The former Royal Palace:</h2><p>Royal Palace
      was built extending a former boyar house used by rulers of Romania by
      adding two wings to it in the late 19th century to be representative
      enough for Carol I, the new king of Romania. Palace was rebuilt in the
      late 1930s after a fire by King Carol II. In December 1947, the monarchy
      was abolished in Romania, and the last king, Michael, left his country the
      Palace Today, the former Royal Palace houses the valuable National Art
      Museum, with a particularly interesting section of Medieval
      Art.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Piata Revolutiei:</h2><p>The square is considered
      to be the most essential and representative square of Bucharest, where the
      roots of the history of the city and the entire country are rooted; the
      square is mainly remembered as the place where protests began to topple
      Romanian dictator Tsuachescu and the removal of communist rule in the
      country, here from the balcony of the Communist Party headquarters today
      The masses, especially the rally held in late December 1989, after which
      the protesters seized the Palatul Regal Palace, arrested the tyrant and
      his wife, and later executed them.</p><h2>Romanian Athenaeum:</h2><p>The
      Romanian Athenaeum is considered one of the most important and beautiful
      buildings in the city of Bucharest and serves as the home of the Bucharest
      Philharmonic Orchestra. The construction of the magnificent building was
      completed in 1888. Built in the neoclassical style, it features a porch of
      marble columns, gold moldings, and a unique and beautiful ceiling. The
      acoustics in the auditorium are considered particularly good because of
      their unique structure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bucharest National Opera
      House:</h2><p>We booked tickets for 16 USD per person. We saw the Opera
      Turandot. To order tickets,<a href="http://operanb.ro/?lang=en"> click
      here!</a> We have seen a ballet in the opera house in Rome and the opera
      house in Bucharest takes Rome's national opera house by far!! The show was
      much more invested, and the Opera House was insanely
      amazing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>DAY 5 -<br />Bucharest:</h2><p>We woke up,
      had breakfast, and headed towards the Parliament castle.</p><h2>Tour
      Inside Parliament Castle:</h2><p>Start your morning with a tour in the
      heaviest building in the world. It is gorgeous inside!</p><p>Starting in
      1984, The Palace has a height of 84 meters, a floor area of 365,000 square
      meters, and a volume of 2,550,000 cubic meters. The Palace of the
      Parliament is the heaviest building in the world, weighing about
      4,098,500,000 kilograms. The Palace of Parliament is the world&rsquo;s
      second-largest administrative building (after the Pentagon) and former
      dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu&rsquo;s most infamous creation. Entry is a
      guided tour only (book ahead), and you must bring
      identification.</p><h2>ETHEL CAFE:</h2><p>Cute coffee shop with fantastic
      d&eacute;cor. It is a little on the expensive side, but it is very
      delicious, the place is clean, and the drinks are fresh. Make sure to
      <strong>make a reservation</strong> since the cafe is pretty
      tiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Visit National Village Museum:</h2><p>Heratrau
      Park is the largest and most beautiful park in this city. The village
      museum is one of the first open-air ethnographic museums in the world, so
      don't miss it!</p><h2>Arch of Triumph:</h2><p>The Triumph Arch is located
      on <strong>Kiseleff Street</strong> next to Herăstrău Park. It is one of
      the capital's most notable landmarks and one of the symbols of Bucharest.
      The reinforced concrete structure was inaugurated in 1922 to celebrate the
      victory of Romania in World War I, and the event was attended by the most
      important political figures of the time.</p><p><em>The weather got pretty
      bad, so we took the afternoon to relax in our apartment and got ready to
      go for our last night in Bucharest.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Miau
      Cafe:</h2><p>We decided to go to a cat cafe since we'd never experienced
      it before and loved it. The cats are so friendly and sweet.</p><p>It does
      get pretty crowded, and there is no way to reserve online, so do know that
      you might have to wait a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>JW Marriot Grand
      Casino:</h2><p>We headed towards the Marriot hotel. The hotel is located
      close to the parliament building, and we heard they have a friendly
      casino, so we decided to go just to try our luck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Romania has surprised us, and we will be back! I recommend
      spending at least two nights in Sinaia, it's so beautiful.</strong></p>

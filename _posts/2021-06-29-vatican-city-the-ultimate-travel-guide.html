      <p><strong>The Vatican City, is a city-state surrounded by Rome. Although
      it is the smallest country in the world it is the headquarters of the
      Roman Catholic Church, home to the Pope and a trove of iconic art and
      architecture. Its Vatican Museums house ancient Roman sculptures as well
      as Renaissance frescoes in the Raphael Rooms and the Sistine Chapel,
      famous for Michelangelo&rsquo;s ceiling.</strong></p>

      <h2><strong>How long should you spend here:</strong></h2><p>You can easily
      see everything the Vatican city has to offer in <strong>one day</strong>,
      but we decided to do so in 2 days since both main activities in the
      Vatican City are just too massive to do in one day.</p><h2><strong>How to
      get to the Vatican City:</strong></h2><p>It is easily accessed to get to
      by foot, metro, or bus.<br /><strong>By foot:</strong> By foot, it is
      about a 30-minute walk from all the main attractions in Rome and walking
      in Rome offers the best views.<br /><strong>Metro:</strong> If you'd like
      to take the metro, the nearest metro stop is Ottaviano on line A (red)<br
      /><strong>Bus:</strong> By bus you'll take the 40 and 64 which run the
      most frequently.</p>

      <h2><strong>Papal Audience:</strong></h2><p>When the Pope is at home in
      Vatican City, he gives an audience each Wednesday morning in St.
      Peter&rsquo;s Square that is open to anyone who would like to join.
      Therefore we recommend you avoid visiting St. Peter's Square on Wednesdays
      unless you are interest in witnessing this.</p>

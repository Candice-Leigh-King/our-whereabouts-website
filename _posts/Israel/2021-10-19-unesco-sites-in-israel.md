      <h2><strong>8. BIBLICAL TELS - MEGIDDO, HAZOR &amp; BE'ER
      SHEVA</strong></h2><p>Tels (prehistoric settlement mounds) are
      characteristic of the flatter lands of the eastern Mediterranean. Of more
      than 200 tels in Israel, Megiddo, Hazor, and Beer Sheba are representative
      of those that contain substantial remains of cities with biblical
      connections. The three tels also present some of the best examples in the
      Levant of elaborate Iron Age, underground water-collecting systems,
      created to serve dense urban communities. Their traces of construction
      over the millennia reflect the existence of centralized authority,
      prosperous agricultural activity, and the control of important trade
      routes.</p><p>All three tels have been generally left untouched and intact
      since their decline, and subsequent abandonment, between the 10th and 4th
      centuries BCE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Tel Hazor:</h3><p>Tel Hatsor is
      identified with the biblical Hatsor &ndash; perhaps the greatest of the
      cities of the land of Israel in the Late Canaanite
      period.</p><ul><li>Entrance fee: <strong>6.8$ for
      adults.</strong></li><li>Location: <strong>Rosh Pinna, Northern
      Israel.</strong></li><li>Opening hours: Sunday&ndash;Thursday and
      Saturday: 8 AM until 5 PM, Friday and holiday eves: 8 AM until 4 PM
      (During the winter the park closes an hour earlier).</li></ul><h3>Tel
      Be'er Sheva:</h3><p>Tel Be&rsquo;er Sheva, the area in which the
      forefathers of the Jewish nation (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) lived and
      worked, is an important biblical tel &ndash; one of three from the days of
      the Bible that UNESCO has included in its list of world heritage
      sites.</p><ul><li>Entrance fee: <strong>4.3$ for
      adults.</strong></li><li>Location:<strong> Be'er Sheva, Southern
      Israel.</strong></li><li>Opening hours: Sunday&ndash;Thursday and
      Saturday: 8 AM until 5 PM, Friday and holiday eves: 8 AM until 4 PM
      (During the winter the park closes an hour earlier).</li></ul><h3>Tel
      Megiddo:&nbsp;</h3><p>Megiddo was one of the strongest and most important
      cities of Canaan. The remains of the palaces, temples, gates and the
      sophisticated water system of the city are evidence of its great
      power.</p><ul><li>Entrance fee: <strong>8.6$ for
      adults.</strong></li><li>Location: near <strong>Kibbutz Megiddo, Northern
      Israel.</strong></li><li>Opening hours: Sunday&ndash;Thursday and

      NEGEV:</strong></h2><p>The four Nabatean towns of Haluza, Mamshit, Avdat,
      and Shivta, along with associated fortresses and agricultural landscapes
      in the Negev Desert, are spread along routes linking them to the
      Mediterranean end of the incense and spice route. They reflect the hugely
      profitable trade in frankincense and myrrh from south Arabia to the
      Mediterranean, which flourished from the 3rd century BC until the 2nd
      century AD.</p><p>If I had to choose 2 out of the four, I'd recommend
      visiting Shivta and Avdat.</p><h4>Mamshit:</h4><p>Mamshit National Park

      and presents Nabatean architecture in all its glory, against the desert
      backdrop of the northern Negev hills</p><ul><li>Admission Fee:
      <strong>6.8$ for adults.</strong></li><li>Location:<strong>
      </strong>near<strong> Be'er Sheva.</strong></li><li>Opening hours:

      eves: 8 AM until 4 PM (During the winter the park closes an hour

      showcases the impressive remains of a Byzantine city that existed in the
      heart of a desert area with no natural water sources whatsoever. The
      splendid churches, streets, and homes are astonishing even
      today.</p><ul><li>Admission Fee:
      <strong>Free.</strong></li><li>Location:<strong> </strong>near<strong>
      Be'er Sheva.</strong></li><li>Opening hours: Sunday&ndash;Thursday and

      earlier).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Avdat:</h4><p>In the heart of the
      desert, on a hilltop above the Tsin Stream watercourse, are the impressive
      remains of an ancient Nabatean city.</p><ul><li>Admission Fee:
      <strong>8.6$ for adults.</strong></li><li>Location:<strong> Dimona,
      Sothern Israel</strong></li><li>Opening hours: Sunday&ndash;Thursday and
      Saturday: 8 AM until 5 PM, Friday and holiday eves: 8 AM until 4 PM
      (During the winter the park closes an hour

      the only site that isn't under the supervision of the national parks here
      in Israel and therefore I don't recommend it.</p><ul><li>Admission Fee:
      <strong>Free</strong></li><li>Location:<strong> Dimona, Sothern
      Israel</strong></li><li>Opening hours: open
      freely.</li><li><strong>WARNINGS:</strong> Do you know that sadly there

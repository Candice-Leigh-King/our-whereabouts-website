    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>SOME HISTORY:</strong></h2><p>Israel gained independence in 1948. It is a relatively new country Israel is a small country. It is number 149 in its territory in the world out of 194 countries. You can drive from one end to the other in just 5.5 hours. (north to south).</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>RELIGION:</strong></h2><p>Israel is a Jewish state and 74% of the citizens are Jewish. When visiting certain places that are holy/religious such as the western wall and synagogues one should dress modestly. Weekends here are Thursday night until Saturday night. The religious Jews celebrate the Sabbath starting Friday at sunset until Saturday night. The religious Jews believe that the Sabbath is a time to rest by not using electricity, drive or do any sort of work. Most of the country is closed for 25 hours. There are cities/neighborhoods in Israel that you can not enter by car during the Sabbath.</p><h2><br /><strong>CURRENCY:</strong></h2><p>In Israel, we have the NIS (New Israeli Shekel), most places will not accept USD unless you are in a very touristy place.<br />Israel is a very modern country, it is a country that is very accessible to people and tourists in particular. There are many banks to pull out money from, it is possible to pay by credit card anywhere.</p>"

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p><strong>The best time to visit:&nbsp;</strong>is between March-May (spring) and October-November (Autumn) because it is great weather for traveling, hiking and you can still go to the beach.<br />Israel is a Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea, therefore it is warm here compared to other countries.</p><p><strong>Winter in Israel</strong> is from December until February. The average temperature in winter is between 5 and 20 degrees, depending on where you are.</p><p><strong>Summer in Israel </strong>is from June-September. The Summer here is very difficult to deal with sometimes.<br />Don't forget that because we are so close to the ocean we have high humidity levels that we feel in the summer. The average temperature in summer is between 25-40 degrees. Midday in the summer the temperatures are usually in the region of 35 degrees (depending on where you are in the middle of the day) and can even reach up to 45 degrees down south.</p><p>It is very hard to enjoy everything the country has to offer during this time, but it is the ideal time to come and enjoy Israel's beaches.</p><p>On that note, I do want to make it clear that you can still enjoy Israel's beaches from May-November.</p><p>\_</p>"

      <h2><strong>WHAT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN BOOKING YOUR
      TRIP:</strong></h2><p><strong>It is very important to look at the Jewish
      calendar before booking your trip.</strong></p><p>During our Jewish
      holidays, prices can double, and places can get very crowded because we
      have a small country and most Israeli's love to travel.</p><h2>Our biggest
      holidays are:</h2><p><br /><strong>•PASSOVER:<br />Crowds:
      </strong>Passover is one of our biggest holidays and Jews from all over
      the world travel to Israel to celebrate this holiday in Israel.<br
      /><strong>Dietary Restrictions:</strong> During Passover there are several
      dietary restrictions that must be observed. These restrictions are based
      on the biblical account of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and the
      subsequent journey through the desert. One of the primary restrictions
      during Passover is that leavened bread (chametz) is not allowed. This
      includes bread, cake, cookies, pasta, and any other food made from wheat,
      barley, rye, oats, or spelt that has been allowed to rise or ferment.
      Additionally, grains such as corn, rice, and legumes like beans and
      lentils are also prohibited during Passover. You can find Chametz in
      Israel during Passover but it will be difficult in some areas and you
      definitely wont find the 'Chametz' in stores either.<br /><strong>Dates:
      </strong>Passover usually falls around March or April (7 day holiday) so
      if you're planning a trip during March and April, look at a jewish
      calender before.<br /><strong>Prices: </strong>Due to everything I
      mentioned, prices rise and food and hotels will be way more expensive than
      it usually is.</p><p><strong>•JEWISH NEW YEAR AND TISHREI
      HOLIDAYS:&nbsp;</strong><br />Jewish New Year and Tishrei holidays are
      September or October (~3 weeks). If you're planning a trip to Israel in
      September-October I would google 'Rosh Hashanah', 'Yom Kippur' and
      'Succot' and the year to be able to see the exact dates are.<br />There
      aren't any dietary restrictions here but due know that it can get crowded
      and public transportation might be limited.</p>

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>ACCOMMODATION:</strong></h2><p>The hotels are pretty expensive here and it is best to check into Zimmers (cabins) or Airbnbs.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>TRANSPORTATION:</strong></h2><p>We recommend renting a car. Public Transportation in most of the country doesn't work during the sabbath and if you have a car there are plenty of places you could enjoy during the sabbath such as National parks</p><h2>Apps that can help:</h2><ul><li>Rav Kav - A card that you can pre-pay for transportation and use on buses and trains. These days in some buses you can not pay the bus driver, you need to fill your Rav Kav card with money and scan the card when you get on the bus and it'll take off the bus fee from the card. There is a Rav Kav app and you can refill it there.</li><li>Moviit - This app offers guidance on how to use public transportation to get you from one point to another if it's by train, bus, and walking, they connect it all.</li><li>Google Maps - This app is one of my favorites. Usually, before I go to a new destination I create a map on google maps and pin all the locations I would like to go to including restaurants, Insta-Worthy locations, and more.</li></ul><ul><li>For more apps that can help you check out this blog post<a href=\"https://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/must-have-apps-israel\"> 7 must-have apps!</a></li></ul>"

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>LANGUAGE:</strong></h2><p>In Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are mostly spoken, but most of the people here know English at a good level, many even excellent, this is due to the fact that a lot of English is taught here in schools and universities, and all the TV movies and series we see in English.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>SHOPPING:</strong></h2><p>Shopping (Makeup, clothes, and electronics) in Israel is relatively expensive, So do not forget your essentials at home. Bring short sleeve shirts and a warm layer in case it gets cold and bring comfortable shoes.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>TAP WATER:</strong></h2><p>You can actually drink tap water in Israel, it is really good.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>REGIONS:</strong></h2><ul><li>Northern - Tzfat, Kinneret, Akko and Golan.</li><li>Haifa - Haifa and Hadera.</li><li>Central - Sharon, Peta Tikva, Ramla and Rehovot.</li><li>Tel Aviv.</li><li>Jerusalem.</li><li>Southern - Ashkelon, Be'er Sheva, and Eilat.</li><li>Judea and Samaria.</li></ul>"

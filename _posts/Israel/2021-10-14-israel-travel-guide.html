      <h2><strong>SOME HISTORY:</strong></h2><p>Israel gained independence in
      1948. It is a relatively new country Israel is a small country. It is
      number 149 in its territory in the world out of 194 countries. You can
      drive from one end to the other in just 5.5 hours. (north to south)</p>

      <h2><strong>RELIGION:</strong></h2><p>Israel is a Jewish state and 74% of
      the citizens are Jewish. When visiting certain places that are
      holy/religious such as the western wall and synagogues one should dress
      modestly. Weekends here are Thursday night until Saturday night. The
      religious Jews celebrate the Sabbath starting Friday at sunset until
      Saturday night. The religious Jews believe that the Sabbath is a time to
      rest by not using electricity, drive or do any sort of work. Most of the
      country is closed for 25 hours. There are cities/neighborhoods in Israel
      that you can not enter by car during the Sabbath</p>

      <h2><strong>ACCOMMODATION:</strong></h2><p>The hotels are pretty expensive
      here and it is best to check into Zimmers (cabins) or
      Airbnbs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>CURRENCY:</strong></h2><p>In Israel,
      we have the NIS (New Israeli Shekel), most places will not accept USD
      unless you are in a very touristy place.</p><p>Israel is a very modern
      country, it is a country that is very accessible to people and tourists in
      particular. There are many banks to pull out money from, it is possible to
      pay by credit card anywhere.</p>

      <h2><strong>TRANSPORTATION:</strong></h2><p>We recommend renting a car.
      Public Transportation in most of the country doesn't work during the
      sabbath and if you have a car there are plenty of places you could enjoy
      during the sabbath such as National parks</p><h3>Apps that can
      help:</h3><ul><li>Rav Kav - A card that you can pre-pay for transportation
      and use on buses and trains. These days in some buses you can not pay the
      bus driver, you need to fill your Rav Kav card with money and scan the
      card when you get on the bus and it'll take off the bus fee from the card.
      There is a Rav Kav app and you can refill it there.</li><li>Moviit - This
      app offers guidance on how to use public transportation to get you from
      one point to another if it's by train, bus, and walking, they connect it
      all.</li><li>Google Maps - This app is one of my favorites. Usually,
      before I go to a new destination I create a map on google maps and pin all
      the locations I would like to go to including restaurants, Insta-Worthy
      locations, and more.</li></ul><ul><li>For more apps that can help you

      <h2><strong>LANGUAGE:</strong></h2><p>In Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are
      mostly spoken, but most of the people here know English at a good level,
      many even excellent, this is due to the fact that a lot of English is
      taught here in schools and universities, and all the TV movies and series
      we see in English.</p>

      <h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p>I recommend visiting between
      March-May (spring) and October-November (Autumn) because it is great
      weather for traveling, hiking and you can still go to the
      beach.</p><p>Israel is a Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea,
      therefore it is warm here compared to other countries.</p><p>Winter in
      Israel is from December until February. The average temperature in winter
      is between 5 and 20 degrees, depending on where you are.</p><h3>Israel in
      winter:</h3><p>Summer in Israel is from June-September. The Summer here is
      very difficult to deal with sometimes.</p><p>Don't forget that because we
      are so close to the ocean we have high humidity levels that we feel in the
      summer</p><p>The average temperature in summer is between 25-40 degrees.
      Midday in the summer the temperatures are usually in the region of 35
      degrees (depending on where you are in the middle of the day) and can even
      reach up 45 degrees down south.</p><p>It is very hard to enjoy everything
      the country has to offer during this time, but it is the ideal time to
      come and enjoy Israel's beaches.</p><p>On that note, I do want to make it
      clear that you can still enjoy Israel's beaches from
      May-November.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><strong>WHAT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN BOOKING YOUR
      TRIP:</strong></h2><p>It is very important to look at the Jewish calendar
      before booking your trip.</p><p>During our Jewish holidays, prices can
      double, and places can get very crowded because most Israeli's love to
      travel.</p><p>Our biggest holidays are:</p><p>Passover usually falls
      around March or April (7 day holiday).</p><p>Jewish New Year and Tishrei
      holidays are September or October (~3 weeks). If you're planning a trip to
      Israel in September-October I would google 'Rosh Hashanah', 'Yom Kippur'
      and 'Succot' and the year to be able to see the exact dates are.</p>

      <h2><strong>SHOPPING:</strong></h2><p>Shopping (Makeup, clothes, and
      electronics) in Israel is relatively expensive, So do not forget your
      essentials at home. Bring short sleeve shirts and a warm layer in case it
      gets cold and bring comfortable shoes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>TAP
      WATER:</strong></h2><p>You can actually drink tap water in Israel, it is
      really
      good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>REGIONS:</strong></h2><ul><li>Northern -
      Tzfat, Kinneret, Akko and Golan.</li><li>Haifa - Haifa and
      Hadera.</li><li>Central - Sharon, Peta Tikva, Ramla and
      Rehovot.</li><li>Tel Aviv.</li><li>Jerusalem.</li><li>Southern - Ashkelon,
      Be'er Sheva, and Eilat.</li><li>Judea and Samaria.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>The Dead sea:</strong></h2><p>This is one of my favorites too.
      Honestly, there is nothing like the feeling you get after spending time
      inside these salty waters!</p><h4>Things to know before you
      visit:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>South</li><li><strong>Our
      Rating:</strong>&nbsp;#2 best beach. Must-see
      beach!</li><li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> depends on which beach you
      go to, there are many options (it verays between free entrance to 15$
      fee).</li><li>Ein Bokek Beach - this beach is free of charge with toilets,
      all you need to do is pay for parking which is about 1.5$ per
      hour.</li><li>Don't forget to buy the dead sea mud <strong>before</strong>
      you get to the dead sea. Dead sea mud in the dead sea is double the price
      and sometimes even x3 the price. You can easily find dead sea products all
      over Israel.</li><li>Staying at a hotel in the dead sea can get pretty
      expensive, you can save money by buying a day pass to the hotel that
      includes their spa, pools, lunch, and the hotel's private beach for about
      60$. You can also save money by sleeping in an Airbnb outside of the dead
      sea you can just make it a day trip there from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or
      wherever your hotel/Airbnb is.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>Coral Reef,
      Eilat:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Nature
      reserve</strong></h3><p>Eilat is a city located in southern Israel by the
      red sea and borders Egypt. The coral reef is a national reserve and it is
      my favorite beach because it is the best place in Israel to go snorkeling
      or scuba diving. Throughout the years I've seen amazing creatures and it
      never stops to amaze me.</p><h4>Things you should know about the Coral
      reef:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>South</li><li><strong>Our
      rating: </strong>#1 best beach! Don't miss it!</li><li><strong>Entrance

      rent snorkeling equipment, but best bring your own to save
      money.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Sevices:</strong> There are bathrooms,
      showers, minimarket, and even lockers. From my experience this is a
      family-friendly place and we have never felt the need to use a locker but
      if need be a locker is about 3$)</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>LITTLE SWITZERLAND, MOUNT CARMEL</strong></h2><p>In the Carmel
      Mountains near Haifa, there is a nature reserve called 'Little
      Switzerland' because it is somewhat reminiscent of the landscapes of
      Switzerland. Very green reserve and lots of vegetation and
      mountains.</p><p>There are a few routes that can be done, we did the
      circular partial route because we wanted to see some nature and also to
      see the hidden gem of the route, a place called 'The Pipe'.</p><h3>How to
      get to the pipe?</h3><p>From the Little Switzerland parking lot, we
      followed the route marked in 𝗿𝗲𝗱, after a walk of about 700 meters, you
      will reach a split of paths with a 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 marked path to the left into
      a shady stream channel.</p><p>I must point out that it is very easy to
      miss it and continued walking.</p><p>After about 10 minutes of ascent, you
      will see a 𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁.</p><p>It
      says there is a rock with a marking of two white stripes, but it is very
      difficult to spot it so just look for the iron gate. This is where we get
      off the green path towards the pipe. A minute and a half of walking down a
      narrow path will lead us to the pipe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What is the
      pipe?</h3><p>It is a kind of half-horizontal pipe hewn in the rock. It is
      not really clear how the pipes were formed and there are claims that they
      were formed by water flows that eroded the rock.</p><h4>Things to know
      before you go:</h4><ul><li>&nbsp;Waze: 'little Switzerland parking
      lot'</li><li>Route: 2 hours</li><li>Level of hike: easy-medium (wear
      comfortable shoes)</li><li>Admission: Mid-week free.</li><li>When to
      visit: Midweek, any season, just make sure not to visit during the rainy
      season.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><strong>MASADA</strong></h2><p>Masada is one of the most important and
      central places in Israel</p><p>This is a place that is usually very busy
      on weekends so it is advisable to schedule your arrival during the
      week.</p><p>It is a place with a lot of history so we would recommend
      coming with a guide or on an organized trip so you can really enjoy this
      place.</p><p>Due to its proximity to the Dead Sea, you can combine your
      trip to Masada with the dead sea!</p><p>It is recommended to come to see
      the sunrise, but keep in mind that it is a 3-hour drive from Tel Aviv, so
      either you will sleep in the Dead Sea.</p><h4>Things to know before you
      go:</h4><ul><li>︎Entrance fee: Adult 9.5$</li><li>︎There are a few ways to
      get up:<br />1. Snake path - This is the long path up to the mountain.

      closes for a descent one hour before closing time. On very hot days the
      Snake Path ascent closes at 09:00 AM and the descent closes at 10:00 AM.
      When heat is extreme, the Snake Path ascent closes at 08:00, and the
      descent close at 09:00. The descent via the Roman Ramp is open as
      usual.<br />2. The Roman ramp path - This is the short path. Starting

      <h2><strong>ROSH HA'NIKRA</strong></h2><p>If you drive up Israel&rsquo;s
      lovely coastline, you will reach Rosh Hanikra, Israel's northernmost edge
      of the coast.</p><p>Rosh Hanikra, a glorious towering cliff dotted with
      winding grottoes.</p><p>A short walk at the heart of the cliff reveals the
      grottos which are actually marine caves. The grottos were created
      following a series of subterranean tremors which cracked the rock.
      Rainwater flowing through these cracks and the gushing sea waves created
      this natural phenomenon, unique in Israel!</p><p>The cable car route which
      is the shortest and steepest in the world takes the visitors 70 meters
      down at a 60 degrees angle. The view from the cable car is nothing but
      magnificent.</p><h4>Things to know before you go:</h4><ul><li>The cable
      car costs: Adults - 15$</li><li>︎Visiting hours: Summer weekdays:
      09:00-18:00 Friday and Holiday Eves: 09:00-16:00 Saturdays and Holidays:
      09:00-18:00</li></ul>

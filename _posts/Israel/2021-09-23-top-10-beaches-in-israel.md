      <h2><strong>The Dead sea:</strong></h2><p>This is one of my favorites too.
      Honestly, there is nothing like the feeling you get after spending time
      inside these salty waters!</p><h4>Things to know before you
      visit:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>South</li><li><strong>Our
      Rating:</strong>&nbsp;#2 best beach. Must-see
      beach!</li><li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> depends on which beach you
      go to, there are many options (it verays between free entrance to 15$
      fee).</li><li>Ein Bokek Beach - this beach is free of charge with toilets,
      all you need to do is pay for parking which is about 1.5$ per
      hour.</li><li>Don't forget to buy the dead sea mud <strong>before</strong>
      you get to the dead sea. Dead sea mud in the dead sea is double the price
      and sometimes even x3 the price. You can easily find dead sea products all
      over Israel.</li><li>Staying at a hotel in the dead sea can get pretty
      expensive, you can save money by buying a day pass to the hotel that
      includes their spa, pools, lunch, and the hotel's private beach for about
      60$. You can also save money by sleeping in an Airbnb outside of the dead
      sea you can just make it a day trip there from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or
      wherever your hotel/Airbnb is.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>Coral Reef,
      Eilat:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Nature
      reserve</strong></h3><p>Eilat is a city located in southern Israel by the
      red sea and borders Egypt. The coral reef is a national reserve and it is
      my favorite beach because it is the best place in Israel to go snorkeling
      or scuba diving. Throughout the years I've seen amazing creatures and it
      never stops to amaze me.</p><h4>Things you should know about the Coral
      reef:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>South</li><li><strong>Our
      rating: </strong>#1 best beach! Don't miss it!</li><li><strong>Entrance
      fee:</strong> Adults 10$, kids 6.5$</li><li><strong>Parking fee:</strong>
      about 1.5$ per hour.</li><li>If you have National card membership: Free
      entrance for more info<a
      href="https://fe.sales.parks.org.il/subscriptions"> click
      here</a></li><li>The water is pretty cold all year long.</li><li>You can
      rent snorkeling equipment, but best bring your own to save
      money.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Sevices:</strong> There are bathrooms,
      showers, minimarket, and even lockers. From my experience this is a
      family-friendly place and we have never felt the need to use a locker but
      if need be a locker is about 3$)</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>ROSH HA'NIKRA</strong></h2><p>If you drive up Israel&rsquo;s
      lovely coastline, you will reach Rosh Hanikra, Israel's northernmost edge
      of the coast.</p><p>Rosh Hanikra, a glorious towering cliff dotted with
      winding grottoes.</p><p>A short walk at the heart of the cliff reveals the
      grottos which are actually marine caves. The grottos were created
      following a series of subterranean tremors which cracked the rock.

      this natural phenomenon, unique in Israel!</p><p>The cable car route which

      <h2><strong>GAN HA'SHLOSHA (SAHNE)</strong></h2><p>For the water lovers
      among you, this is a place that tourists are not so familiar with and it
      is located in an area called the Valley of the springs, with its jewel
      being a place called Gan Hashlosha - the Sahne.</p><p>Sahne comes from the
      Arabic word Sakhne which means Hot! 🔥</p><p>It is a very beautiful
      national park that gives the feeling that you are in an oasis.</p><p>For
      those who have been to Mexico this place is pretty similar to a
      Cenote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Things to know before you
      go:</h3><ul><li>Entrance fee: this park is pretty expensive compared to
      others. Even if you have the Israeli national park pass you have to pay
      50% of the price!</li><li>Adult - 12$</li><li>Opening hours: &bull;Summer
      hours: Saturday-Thursday 8:00-17:00, Friday 8:00-16:00. &bull;Winter

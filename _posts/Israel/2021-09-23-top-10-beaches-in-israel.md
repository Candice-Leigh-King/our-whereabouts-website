    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>1. CORAL REEF:</strong></h2><p>\_</p><h3><strong>Nature reserve</strong></h3><p>Eilat is a city located in southern Israel by the red sea and borders Egypt. The coral reef is a national reserve and it is my favorite beach because it is the best place in Israel to go snorkeling or scuba diving. Throughout the years I've seen amazing creatures and it never stops to amaze me.</p><h4>Things to know before you visit:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>South, Eilat</li><li><strong>Our rating: </strong>#1 best beach! Don't miss it!</li><li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Adults 10$, kids 6.5$</li><li><strong>Parking fee:</strong> about 1.5$ per hour.</li><li>If you have National card membership: Free entrance for more info<a href=\"https://fe.sales.parks.org.il/subscriptions\"> click here</a></li><li>The water is pretty cold all year long.</li><li>You can rent snorkeling equipment, but best bring your own to save money.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Sevices:</strong> There are bathrooms, showers, minimarket, and even lockers.

You can easily find dead sea products all over Israel.</li><li>Staying at a hotel in the dead sea can get pretty expensive, you can save money by buying a day pass to the hotel that includes their spa, pools, lunch, and the hotel's private beach for about 60$. You can also save money by sleeping in an Airbnb outside of the dead sea you can just make it a day trip there from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or wherever your hotel/Airbnb is.</li></ul><p>\_</p><h2><strong>3.

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>6. HERZLIYA BEACH:</strong></h2><p>Herzliya has great beaches and is a little less populated than TLV beaches.</p><p>My favorite beaches there are Apollonia beach and Acadia.</p><p>Acadia Beach is right next to the marina and I love the vibes of this beach but if you are looking for a quieter beach right under Apollonia national park there is a beach that is so mesmerizing.</p><h3>Things to know before you visit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>Center</li><li><strong>Our Rating: </strong>#6 best beach.</li><li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li><li><strong>Parking fee:&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong><em>*Acadia -</em></strong> About 9$ for a whole day in the beach parking lot but you can sometimes find parking in the streets nearby for free if you come during the weekdays. if you come during the week you can usually find parking in the streets nearby for around 1.5$ an hour. <strong><em>*Apollonia -</em></strong> free parking.</li><li><strong>Services: </strong>There are bathrooms and lifeguard (during the season).</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> just a 15-45 minute drive from TLV (depends from where in Tel Aviv)</li><li>A great place to surf.</li><li>A few bars and restuarants on the beach and a mall near by.</li><li>You can rent beach chairs with an umbrella for about 4.5$.</li></ul><p>\_</p><h2><strong>7.

BEIT YANAI BEACH:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Nature reserve</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most beautiful and well-kept beaches in the country. It is a very versatile beach, with many water sports. The Alexander stream meets the sea here and it is simply remarkable.</p><h3>Things to know before you visit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>North<br />About a 45-minute drive from TLV.</li><li><strong>Our Rating: </strong>#8 best beach.</li><li><strong>Entrance and parking fee:</strong> Free!!

NETANYA BEACH:</strong></h2><p>I can't help but share this beach with you because I love the vibe here. Sironit beach is so pretty and less crowded, therefore we really enjoy going there.</p><p>I wouldn't go all the way to this beach, but if you're in the area and you're looking for a quiet beach this is a good one.</p><h4>Things to know before you visit:</h4><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>North.</li><li><strong>Our rating: </strong>#9 best beach.</li><li><strong>Entrance:</strong> free</li><li><strong>Parking fee:</strong> about 1.5$ per hour in the streets nearby.</li><li><strong>Services: </strong>There is a lifeguard and bathrooms.</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> 40 minute drive from TLV.</li></ul><p>\_</p><h2><strong>10. TEL-AVIV BEACHES:</strong></h2><p>Tel Aviv's beaches are worldwide famous. There are so many great beaches in TLV but my favorites have to be Hilton beach, Alma beach &amp; Gordon beach.</p><h3>Things you need to know before you visit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>Center</li><li><strong>Our Rating: </strong>#10 best beach.</li><li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> All beachs are free of charge,</li><li><strong>Services:</strong> They have bathrooms that usually cost about 0.5$ and life gaurds.</li><li>You can rent beach chairs with an umbrella for about 4.5$</li><li>There are many restuarants and bars on the beach where you could sit and enjoy the view but do take into cosideration that the prices will be much more expensive than in a regular restuarant.</li><li><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> mid-week. Do know that these beaches are always busy no matter when you arrive but during the weekends it could get unbareable.</li><li><strong>Parking:</strong> Do take into considerations that it is almost impossible to find parking in the streets by the ocean, and the parking lots are extremely expensive (3 hours parking can reach 20-25$ or more). There are a lot of public transportation that reach Tel Aviv beaches so it is advices to get there by a bus).</li></ul>"

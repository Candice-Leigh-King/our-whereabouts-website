      <h2><strong>Gett (Get taxi)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sadly, we don't have
      Uber in Israel and taxis can be very expensive and sadly, many tourists
      get scammed by the taxi drivers in Israel. This app is great for many
      reasons; you can choose to pay by credit card and not have to deal with
      trying to find the right coins or bills to pay, you also get a map of the
      route from where you're getting picked up to where you want to go that way
      you know the driver isn't taking you in circles just to make more
      money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Waze</strong></h2><p>If you aren't
      familiar with this app yet, you should be. This is the best app while
      driving in Israel. It shows you the quickest routes and alarms when there
      are police around or hazards.</p><h2><strong>Pango</strong></h2><p>Parking
      app. This App is great if you're renting a car in Israel because it is
      responsible for all parking services in Israel, especially for parking on
      city streets.</p><h2><strong>Wolt</strong></h2><p>I don't know about you
      but have you ever been to a foreign country and felt like ordering food
      because you were too tired to go out, but didn't know how to order? This
      app is great if you want food delivery from some of the best
      places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Moovit</strong></h2><p>This app offers
      guidance on how to use public transportation to get you from one point to
      another if it's by train, bus, and walking, they connect it
      all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>xe currency </strong></h2><p>In Israel,
      we use the NIS (New Israeli Shekel) It is easier to use this app in order
      to know how much you're spending in your
      currency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>KVISI </strong></h2><p>If you're
      looking for a place to clean clothes this app is for you. This app
      provides laundry services and offers free pick up and delivery of the
      clothes.</p>

      <p>If you're planning a trip to Israel it is important to know that Israel
      is a relatively expensive country, but it does not have to be that way. In
      this post, I will give you examples of how you can save money on your trip
      to Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Currency:</strong></h2><p>The
      currency in Israel is NIS (New Israeli Shekel). When landing in Israel you
      could exchange some cash at the airport but they overcharge
      there.</p><h3><strong>How to Save money:</strong></h3><p>Bring 200-300 NIS
      with you from the country you come with and exchange more money in Israel
      as need be. The best places to exchange your money are the bank and post
      office.</p>

      <h2><strong>Hotels:</strong></h2><p>Hotels in Israel are very expensive,
      especially if you are looking in staying in hot spots and big
      cities.</p><p>For example, in the Jerusalem/Tel Aviv area, a night in a
      3-star hotel could cost 200$.</p><h3><strong>How to Save
      money:</strong></h3><p>The best way to save money is by renting an
      apartment. There are many beautiful and cheap apartments in the
      country.</p><p>Another is sleeping in a Zimmer. A Zimmer is the Israeli
      version of Bed and breakfasts but generally smaller, more private, and
      often, more luxurious. Zimmers are owned privately and are sometimes
      located on the grounds of a family home.</p><p>Another way is sleeping in
      a city nearby. For example, if you're looking into visiting Tel Aviv, I
      would look for a hotel in either Ramat Gan or Givati'im which are both on
      the borders of Tel
      Aviv.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Restaurants:</strong></h2><p>Most
      restaurants in the country are expensive, a meal in a regular restaurant
      can cost $20 for just the main course and a drink per
      person.</p><h3><strong>How to save money:</strong></h3><p>Eat at food
      stands. Food stands are pretty common here and there is no need to be
      afraid to eat in the food stands in Israel because there is a lot of food
      control by the Ministry of Health in the country and so many people eat
      there that there is always food
      turnover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Transportation:</strong></h2><p>Trains
      and taxis are pretty expensive in Israel. For example, a 15-minute ride in
      a taxi within the city can easily cost $20 and even 30$ in
      Tel-Aviv.</p><h3><strong>How to save money:</strong></h3><p>Sadly, we
      don't have Uber in the country, but it is pretty comfortable, safe, and
      cheap to get around by bus or light rail. on weekends there are also night
      lines that run until 4 AM in the big cities. There are also bicycles and
      scooters that you can rent around popular cities like Tel-Aviv.</p>

      <h2><strong>Parks and Attractions:</strong></h2><p>Parks and attractions
      can cost around $7-15 depending on what you are planning on doing
      here.</p><h3><strong>How to save money:</strong></h3><p>Israel has 49
      national parks, and 43 nature reserves. If you plan on going to many it is
      worth getting an annual subscription called 'Matmon' that costs about $40
      for an entire year. It gives free admission to almost all the parks and
      discounts to some of the attractions.</p><p>There are also many free
      attractions in Israel that I will be talking about
      soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Shopping:</strong></h2><p>Buying
      clothes, shoes, cosmetics, and electronics are expensive in Israel, so
      rely on going on a shopping spree while visiting
      Israel.</p><h3><strong>How to save money:</strong></h3><p>In Eilat, there
      is no VAT and therefore there is 17% of the price compared to the rest of
      the country so if you must buy things in Israel I recommend you shop
      there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Food shopping:</strong></h2><p>When
      staying in the center of the big cities you do not want to buy in the Mini
      Markets because prices can be 3 times more expensive than any other
      supermarket.</p><h3><strong>How to save money:</strong></h3><p>A great way
      to save money is to cook in your apartment. It is worth going a bit
      outside the city center to shop at a big supermarket. The cheap chains are
      'Rami Levy' רמי לוי , 'Shufersal Deal' שופרסל דיל , 'Yochannoff'
      יוחננוף.</p><p>On top of that, we also recommend you visit the Shuk
      (market) that sells fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish for the best
      price. Don't forget to bargain! It is popular in Israel.</p>

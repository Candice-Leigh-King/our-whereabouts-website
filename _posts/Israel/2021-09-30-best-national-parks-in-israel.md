      <h2><strong>BEIT GUVRIN CAVES</strong></h2><p>Beit Guvrin is not only a
      national park but also a UNESCO world heritage site Located not too far
      from Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fairly large complex, which includes
      about 5 different sites with the main ones being Tel Maresha, Maresha
      caves, The northern city complex, and the reconstructed ancient wine press
      and olive press.</p><p>The highlight is the caves that are spectacular in
      beauty but apart from the caves the area is very beautiful and there are
      great trails, beautiful ruins, and interesting history.</p><h3>Things you
      should know before you go:</h3><ul><li>Admission costs: Adult $
      7.5</li><li>Transportation: Because the compound is large inside, you
      travel by car from place to place and park near each site.</li><li>When
      entering you get a very understandable map to use.</li><li>The site is
      open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</li><li>it is recommended to arrive
      in the middle of the week, early from a place to enjoy it
      properly.</li><li>in winter, the place is much greener but it should be
      taken into account that the caves close for safety reasons, so it is
      recommended to check before if the caves open.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>MITZPEH RAMON:</strong></h2><p>Mitzprh Ramon is the viewpoint
      where you can see the Maktesh Ramon - the largest erosion crater in the
      world!</p><p>We always enjoy visiting this place on the way down south of
      Israel.</p><p>This is a unique place you don't want to
      miss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Things to know before you
      go:</h4><ul><li>︎Entrance fee: &bull; If you want to just enjoy the view
      it is free you can walk around. &bull; For 8.4$ (kids costs 4$) you can go
      into the Mitzpeh Ramon visitor Crater which tells the geological story of
      the formation of the makhtesh, the largest landform of its type in the
      world. As part of the exhibition is the Ilan Ramon Memorial, telling the
      story of Israel&rsquo;s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon who died in the 2003
      Colombia Disaster, and loved the Ramon Crater and surrounding desert area.
      I recommend this for first-timers!</li><li>︎Fun tip - there are mountain
      goats all around there, they are used to people and will come up close. I
      usually pack some carrots and feed them</li><li>︎My best tip, go during
      sunrise or sunset!!! With a view like this, a sunrise/sunset can add so
      much</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>LITTLE SWITZERLAND, MOUNT CARMEL</strong></h2><p>In the Carmel
      Mountains near Haifa, there is a nature reserve called 'Little
      Switzerland' because it is somewhat reminiscent of the landscapes of
      Switzerland. Very green reserve and lots of vegetation and
      mountains.</p><p>There are a few routes that can be done, we did the
      circular partial route because we wanted to see some nature and also to
      see the hidden gem of the route, a place called 'The Pipe'.</p><h3>How to
      get to the pipe?</h3><p>From the Little Switzerland parking lot, we
      followed the route marked in 𝗿𝗲𝗱, after a walk of about 700 meters, you
      will reach a split of paths with a 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 marked path to the left into
      a shady stream channel.</p><p>I must point out that it is very easy to
      miss it and continued walking.</p><p>After about 10 minutes of ascent, you
      will see a 𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁.</p><p>It
      says there is a rock with a marking of two white stripes, but it is very
      difficult to spot it so just look for the iron gate. This is where we get
      off the green path towards the pipe. A minute and a half of walking down a
      narrow path will lead us to the pipe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What is the
      pipe?</h3><p>It is a kind of half-horizontal pipe hewn in the rock. It is
      not really clear how the pipes were formed and there are claims that they
      were formed by water flows that eroded the rock.</p><h4>Things to know
      before you go:</h4><ul><li>&nbsp;Waze: 'little Switzerland parking
      lot'</li><li>Route: 2 hours</li><li>Level of hike: easy-medium (wear
      comfortable shoes)</li><li>Admission: Mid-week free.</li><li>When to
      visit: Midweek, any season, just make sure not to visit during the rainy
      season.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><strong>MASADA</strong></h2><p>Masada is one of the most important and
      central places in Israel</p><p>This is a place that is usually very busy
      on weekends so it is advisable to schedule your arrival during the
      week.</p><p>It is a place with a lot of history so we would recommend
      coming with a guide or on an organized trip so you can really enjoy this
      place.</p><p>Due to its proximity to the Dead Sea, you can combine your
      trip to Masada with the dead sea!</p><p>It is recommended to come to see
      the sunrise, but keep in mind that it is a 3-hour drive from Tel Aviv, so
      either you will sleep in the Dead Sea.</p><h4>Things to know before you
      go:</h4><ul><li>︎Entrance fee: Adult 9.5$</li><li>︎There are a few ways to
      get up:<br />1. Snake path - This is the long path up to the mountain.

      closes for a descent one hour before closing time. On very hot days the
      Snake Path ascent closes at 09:00 AM and the descent closes at 10:00 AM.
      When heat is extreme, the Snake Path ascent closes at 08:00, and the
      descent close at 09:00. The descent via the Roman Ramp is open as
      usual.<br />2. The Roman ramp path - This is the short path. Starting
      point: West entrance. Length: 0.7 Kilometers.<br />3. Cable car - Included
      in the entrance fee You need to make a reservation! Starts working at 8

      <h2><strong>ROSH HA'NIKRA</strong></h2><p>If you drive up Israel&rsquo;s
      lovely coastline, you will reach Rosh Hanikra, Israel's northernmost edge
      of the coast.</p><p>Rosh Hanikra, a glorious towering cliff dotted with
      winding grottoes.</p><p>A short walk at the heart of the cliff reveals the
      grottos which are actually marine caves. The grottos were created
      following a series of subterranean tremors which cracked the rock.
      Rainwater flowing through these cracks and the gushing sea waves created
      this natural phenomenon, unique in Israel!</p><p>The cable car route which
      is the shortest and steepest in the world takes the visitors 70 meters
      down at a 60 degrees angle. The view from the cable car is nothing but
      magnificent.</p><h4>Things to know before you go:</h4><ul><li>The cable
      car costs: Adults - 15$</li><li>︎Visiting hours: Summer weekdays:
      09:00-18:00 Friday and Holiday Eves: 09:00-16:00 Saturdays and Holidays:
      09:00-18:00</li></ul>

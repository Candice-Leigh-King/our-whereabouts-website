      <h2>Tickets:</h2><p>1-day tickets for the Disneyland park 137$ for both of
      us. We got tickets for MiniMagic, which means during the week, not
      weekends. We always prefer to go on a weekday since the weekends and
      holidays get so crazy, and it&rsquo;s hard to enjoy that way. We also tend
      to buy the tickets on the official pages that way, you don't have to wait
      in lines in the morning and convert the tickets you have to Disney
      tickets.</p><h2>Opening hours:</h2><p>Check the hours on the Disney site
      because they change, but you should know something about all Disney parks
      - They open the area of downtown Disney until the castle half an hour
      before written on the official site!!! So if the site says the park opens
      at 10 am, it's best to get there at around 9-9:15, so you could enjoy,
      take some photos and get in line for the opening at 9:30! Everyone gets in
      line so they can rope drop to their favorite rides, such as Peter Pan
      (which could reach up to 100 min wait), Hyperspace mountain, or meet
      Mickey Mouse. Don't forget to take a map of the park! The map has the
      hours If you don't feel like running to the rides, take advantage of the
      empty castle and take some beautiful photos.</p><h2>Fast Pass (Free of
      charge):&nbsp;</h2><p>Next to a few rides, there are Fastpass machines.
      You put your entrance ticket with the bar code into the machine and get a
      Fastpass. The Fastpass has a window of half an hour where you need to come
      back to the ride and go to the Fastpass line. It's very important to get
      fast passes for the busiest rides in order not to waste your day waiting
      in line. List of rides with Fastpass: Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones
      and the Temple of Peril, Peter Pan's Flight, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast,
      Star Tours: The Adventure Continues &amp; Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain
      The busiest rides are: Big Thunder Mountain, Peter Pan &amp; Star Wars
      Hyperspace Mountain.</p><h2>Pre-Paid Fastpass:</h2><p>There are FastPass
      options that you could buy. They are not included in the admission
      tickets.<br />There are four options:</p><p><strong>Super Fastpass:<br
      />This past has 2 options you can choose from:&nbsp;</strong><br />&bull;
      For 40&euro; you can get on three rides- Ratatouille in Disney studios
      park, Peter Pan &amp; Buzz Lightyear.<br />&bull;For 40&euro; you can get
      on three rides - Star Wars Hyperspace, Tower of Terror in Disney studios
      park &amp; Rock n' Roll ride in Disney Studios
      park.</p><p><strong>Ultimate Fastpass:</strong><br /><strong>This past has
      2 options you can choose from:&nbsp;</strong><br />&bull; For 80&euro; you
      could get a ONE-time Fastpass for- Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones and
      the Temple of Peril, Peter Pan's Flight, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Star
      Tours: The Adventure Continues, Star Wars hyperspace mountain &amp; in
      Disney studios - Ratatouille, Tower of Terror &amp; Rock n' Roll.<br
      />&bull; For 132&euro; you could go on all the rides I mentioned before an
      unlimited amount of times. In my opinion, this option is not worth it
      since you could always get a regular Fastpass for those rides once you
      have done them once, and you could also go into the single-rider
      lane.</p><h2>Disney Hotel:&nbsp;</h2><p>When purchasing a night, it
      includes:</p><p>&bull; Admission ticket to the park<br />&bull;
      Breakfast<br />&bull; The location is right on site! Which saves you time
      in the morning standing in line.<br />&bull; You get to use
      <strong>Morning Extra Magic Hours</strong>; You can enter the park 2 hours
      before opening hours and enjoy most of Fantasyland and Tomorrowland
      attractions, as well as character greetings on Main Street.</p><p>All
      Disneyland Hotel guests get a single-use <strong>Hotel FASTPASS</strong>
      for each day of their stay. You get a Fastpass to use any time of the day
      to any ride of your choosing per day in the hotel.</p>

      <h2>How to get to Disneyland from Paris:&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to get
      there is to take the RER A train. It takes about a 40-50 minute ride it's
      a very comfortable way to get to the park just check and see which station
      is closest to your hotel. Our hotel was closest to the Chatelet-Les Halles
      Station. In the morning, we woke up early and walked to the station. It
      was a beautiful walk, and we got to see Paris early morning without the
      crowds. When we got back to the station at 1 AM, we were in a pretty
      uncomfortable situation. We arrived, and the crowds all went to the exit,
      but Dan was thirsty, so we stopped at a machine and ended up kind of
      alone- when we looked for the exit, there were immigrants all over chasing
      girls and people were screaming it was pretty scary. My husband grabbed me
      and ordered an Uber. Just be careful when you leave the train just go with
      the crowd and exit as fast as possible. Important! To save time on the way
      back from Disneyland, get tickets for the way back too!!!</p><h2>Disney
      App:</h2><p>I always recommend downloading the Disney app before arriving
      at the parks. The apps have the hours for shows and hours for characters,
      it shows how long of a wait there is for the rides, and that way, it's
      easier to plan your magical day. Wifi- There is FREE Wi-Fi throughout the
      park. I didn't have a package, and I had wifi the whole day!</p><h2>Disney
      Outfits:</h2><p>Minnie's ears were actually pretty cheap in Paris (As was
      the entrance to the park itself) It was 15&euro; as appose to the US,
      where it was 29$! Tip - If you're looking to save money, I would go and
      buy online. You could find Minnie ears on Etsy, Aliexpress, and Instagram
      there are plenty of people who actually make Minnie's ears. (My trick is I
      buy the Minnie ears in the Disney outlet stores for under 10$).</p><p>As
      always, I recommend buying cute Disney outfits and shirts on Aliexpress or
      any store since at the parks, everything is just so expensive. A t-shirt
      could cost around 30&euro;.</p><h2>Pins/Buttons:&nbsp;</h2><p>At City hall
      (on your left when you enter the park), you could get different kinds of
      pins for occasions that you celebrate in the park, such as birthdays and
      anniversaries. These pins don't usually give you anything, but people
      around the park will congratulate you, and for my birthday in Disneyworld,
      I got a free coffee and Cinnabon from Starbucks in the
      park.</p><h2>Disabilities:</h2><p>If you have a Chronic
      disease/disablitiy, you need to bring a note from your Doctor (GP) that
      states your name and disability in English. You will get a form to give
      the workers for each ride; they give you an hour to return, and then you
      ride without waiting. For more info,<a

      <h2>Sleeping beauty's Castle and Maleficent under the
      castle:&nbsp;</h2><p>Unlike Disneyworld and Disneyland CA, you can go into
      the castle and explore the sleeping beauty story. Under the castle, there
      is a dragon. It's pretty cool check it
      out!</p><h2>Characters:&nbsp;</h2><p>&bull;If there's a particular
      character you want to meet, it is essential to check and see what hours
      they are working since some characters usually do early and also check
      where there's meeting point is. Check the hours on the
      app!</p><p>&bull;Usually, meeting Mickey Mouse's wait time is 70 minutes
      and could get up to 100 minutes, so if it's important for you, I would get
      in line early in the morning or later in the evening.</p><p>&bull;For
      those arriving at the park around Halloween- Mickey is standing near
      Phantom Manor dressed in a Haunted Mansion outfit since they just reopened
      Phantom Manor in Feb 2019. Check it out. Better than regular mickey and
      less of a wait!!!!! Just know - He's there only until 16:00, so make sure
      to get there before.</p><p>&bull;Princess Pavilion - The spot for meeting
      the princess' is right next to It's a small world ride. Do know that the
      average wait time is 100 minutes!</p><p>&bull;Starport - Next to
      Hyperspace mountain has Darth Vader it's about a 40-minute
      wait.</p><h2>Rides:&nbsp;</h2><p>There were a few rides that surprised us!
      They were so much better than Disneyland California and Disneyworld. Such
      as Peter Pan, Pirates on the Caribbean &amp; It's a small world. Phantom
      Manor was creepier in a good way &amp; Hyperspace mountain was star wars
      themes and so epic! There were even a few loops, and it was just AWESOME!
      For you thrill-seekers, you're going to want to do it twice! We rank the
      rides from 1-5 and wrote estimated wait times for rides<a
      href="https://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/rides-in-disneyland-paris">
      click here</a> for more!</p><h2>Food:&nbsp;</h2><p>If you didn't know -
      Disney parks are expensive! Yes, Even the food. a tiny pizza, salad, drink
      and ice cream cost 16&euro; The food in the park disappointed us. In the
      US, food is a big part of the Disney experience. I read online that they
      have Dole Whip, but they don't. We looked! <strong><em>We were very
      frustrated since no one warned us that even though the park closes at
      11:00 p.m., the stores and kiosks with food and snacks close at
      20:00-21:00!!!! We found ourselves looking for food. It was very
      upsetting.</em></strong></p><h2>Water:&nbsp;</h2><p>The park has coolers
      all around. Bring a water bottle and fill them up to save more money on
      buying water.</p><h2>Stars on Parade:&nbsp;</h2><p>In the summer, the
      parade is at 17:30 but always check to see what time it is. Usually, our
      favorite spot is near Casey&rsquo;s so we can see the castle behind while
      we watch the parade. But we arrived at 17:00, and all the good spots were
      taken, but we were still able to get a seat with no one behind
      us.</p><h2>Illumination Show:&nbsp;</h2><p>In the summer, the show is at
      23:00 (the hour that it says the park closes) usually, in the other parks,
      we get a spot an hour before the show, but in Paris, we went around the
      castle area 3 hours before the light show and saw that people were already
      catching a spot! It was nuts. By this time, we had already done every
      single ride in the park, but we wanted to do a few for our second time, so
      we did a few rides and decided to catch a spot 1.5 hours before the
      show.</p><h2>Best spot for Illumination Show:&nbsp;</h2><p>The show tends
      to get crowded. Everyone is taking photos and holding phones up above, and
      people shove. Some people come at night to the park just for the
      Illumination show since they are staying in a Disney hotel, and it's free
      entrance for them. That is why my tip is a good one- We learned that the
      best place to get is a spot where no one could be in front of you! This
      means you need a bar in front like one in the one near the Central Plaza
      plants.</p><h2>Last tip!&nbsp;</h2><p>After the Illumination show,
      everyone is running to get out of the park they are tired and want to
      return to the hotels... This is an opportunity to get fantastic photos of
      the castle at night when no one is around! No filter!!!</p>

      <p>We actually spent a few days in Paris but since we were busy seeing a
      concert and visiting Disneyland we only really got 24 hours to explore
      Paris. We slept in the Latin Quarter and started our day on food from
      there.</p>

      <h2><strong>Breakfast:</strong></h2><p>We started our morning in this
      wonderful caf&eacute; near our hotel. Everything we ate there was just
      heavenly. There is nothing more enjoyable than sitting at a caf&eacute;,
      with great food, watching the people pass by.</p><p><strong>Name of
      caf&eacute;:</strong> Bertrand&rsquo;s.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong>
      10 eur. Lagrange. (not too far from Notre Dame)</p>

      <h2><strong>Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame de
      Paris:</strong></h2><p>Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame, a Gothic
      architectural masterpiece, has adorned the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute;
      since 1163. The famous gargoyles on the fa&ccedil;ade are used to drain
      water from the roofs gutters.</p><p>We were really looking forward to
      going inside this amazing place but sadly in April 2019 there was a large
      fire that partially destroyed the upper part of Notre-Dame Cathedral. The
      fire caused serious damage, but the monument was able to be partly saved.
      <strong>The Cathedral will be accessible to the public in
      2024.</strong></p><p>We then continued towards Pont des Arts along the
      Seine River, enjoying the Parisian architecture along the way and street
      art.</p><h2><strong>Pont des Arts:</strong></h2><p>The famous Bridge of
      Arts, also known as the locket bridge is one of the famous bridges over
      the Seine river. Part of the bridge collapsed due to the weight of the
      locks, nowadays the bridge has plastic shields that were installed and
      left a few locks on each lighting pillar. There are lots of seats on the
      bridge so that you can enjoy the wonderful views and live
      music.</p><p>𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞-𝐕𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐧,
      𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐬 𝐀𝐫𝐭𝐬: From the bridge, we walked towards one of the
      most famous museums in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Mus&eacute;e
      du Louvre:</strong></h2><p>The largest museum in the world, the Louvre has
      a collection of no less than one million works of art. They range from the
      antiquity to the mid 19th century, and the most famous one is, of course,
      the Mona Lisa.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong>17
      EURO.</p><p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Wednesday-Monday from 9am to
      6pm.<a

      <h2><strong>Palais Royal:</strong></h2><p>From the Louvre we walked to
      Palais Royal this place is a really cool spot for Instagram photos. It is
      an absolutely stunning palace, make sure to stroll the garden and the
      courtyard. The history associated with it is very interesting, originally
      called the Palais-Cardinal, it was built for Cardinal Richelieu from about
      1633 to 1639 by the architect Jacques Lemercier.</p><p><strong>Entrance
      Fee: </strong>Free.</p><p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> October-March:
      Every day, from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm. April-September: Every day, from 8:00
      am to 10:30pm.</p><h2><strong>Jardin du Palais
      Royal:</strong></h2><p>There is a beautiful garden too where you could sit
      and just relax. For movie fans out there - the last Mission Impossible
      movie was filmed in Paris so this is one of the spots in the
      movie)</p><h2><strong>Louis Vuitton:</strong></h2><p>There are a few
      handbags made in France and Louis Vuitton is one of them, Therefore it is
      cheaper to buy a Louis Vuitton in Paris because they don't have to pay for
      any import taxes since the headquarters are in Paris.</p><p>I took that
      opportunity to buy my first Louis Vuitton purse in Paris. On top of it
      being cheaper in Paris we also got 12% tax refund at the airport.</p>

      <h2><strong>Jardin des Tuileries:</strong></h2><p>It is one of the most
      beautiful gardens in Paris. The gardens make you feel like you're in a
      palace, the grounds are gorgeous and statues and fountains highlight this
      garden park. The garden is so large it connects the monument of the
      Egyptian Obelisk to the Louvre Museum. If you have to choose between
      Tuileries and Luxembourg gardens choose Tuileries!</p><p><strong>Entrance
      Fee: </strong>Free.</p><p><strong>Opening hours: </strong>September-March:
      7:30am to 7:30pm. May-October: 7:00am to 9:00pm.</p><h2><strong>Place de
      la Concorde:</strong></h2><p>From here you can see the Arc de Triomphe
      from afar. The Place de la Concorde is one of the major public squares in
      Paris. It is the largest square in the French capital. It is located in
      the city's eighth arrondissement, at the eastern end of the
      Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es. It is really
      beautiful.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.</p><h2><strong>Ponte
      Alexander III:</strong></h2><p>From there we went to the Ponte Alexander
      III. This is one of the most beautiful bridges that I have seen. The Pont
      Alexandre III is a deck arch bridge that spans the Seine in Paris. It
      connects the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es quarter with those of the
      Invalides and Eiffel Tower. The bridge is widely regarded as the most
      ornate, extravagant bridge in the city. It has been classified as a French
      monument historique since 1975. <strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.</p>

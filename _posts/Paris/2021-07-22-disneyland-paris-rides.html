      <h1>Rides:</h1><h2>It's a Small World:</h2><p>From the outside, the ride
      'It's a small world is beautiful. It's a little less impressive than the
      small world in California, but it's prettier than the one in Orlando.<br
      /><strong>Rank: </strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br /><strong>Wait time: </strong>20
      minutes.<br /><strong>Ages:</strong> All ages.<br /><strong>Location:
      </strong>Fantasyland</p><h2>Peter Pan's
      Flight:</h2><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br /><strong>Wait time:
      </strong>62 minutes.<br /><strong>Ages: </strong>All ages, even adults!
      It's a MUST DO! The ride here is more fantastic than in California and
      Orlando but it is in French.<br /><strong>Location:</strong>
      Fantasyland.<br /><strong>Fastpass service: </strong>✔️</p><h2>Buzz
      Lightyear Laser Blast:</h2><p><strong>Rank:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br
      /><strong>Wait time: </strong>57 minutes.<br /><strong>Ages: </strong>All
      ages. Great for kids and adults. You get to shoot a laser at aliens and
      even get a score at the end of the ride. This is Dan's Second favorite
      ride.<br /><strong>Location: </strong>Discoveryland.<br /><strong>Fastpass
      services: </strong>✔️</p><h2>Pirates of the Caribbean:</h2><p>The pirates
      of the Caribbean here was actually more "extreme" in comparison to the two
      in the states.<br /><strong>Rank: </strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> 35 minutes.<br /><strong>Ages: </strong>All ages but do
      know that the ride is indoors and pretty dark.<br /><strong>Location:
      </strong>Adventureland</p><h2>Star Wars: Hyperspace
      Mountain:</h2><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5.<br />I Did this twice

      Thrill. The guest must be 1.20 m.<br /><strong>Location:
      </strong>Discoveryland.<br /><strong>Fastpass
      Services:</strong>✔️</p><h2>Phanton Manor (Haunted Mansion):</h2><p>The
      Haunted Mansion is one of the most incredible rides. It is Dan's favorite.
      The ride here is similar to the two in the states. The only difference is
      the ending.<br /><strong>Ranking: </strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br /><strong>Wait
      time:</strong> 25 minutes.<br /><strong>Ages: </strong>Age 5+ The Haunted
      Mansion is dark and contains some mildly frightening scenes, but there is
      no gore, the ghostly residents are friendly and the ride is
      slow-moving.<br /><strong>Location: </strong>Frontierland</p><h2>Star
      Tours: The Adventures Continue:</h2><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐/5<br
      />Do know that this ride is a little rough for those with sensitive

      <h2><strong>1. Decide what you want to see &amp; what you want to
      do:</strong></h2><p>You'll want to see everything, but it's not always
      possible and it's better to concentrate on one or two areas and not regret
      staying somewhere longer &amp; therefore want to go back in the
      future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2. Calculate the time needed to
      drive:</strong></h2><p>Know that the US is a very large place &amp;
      getting around from one place to another can take a few hours, even if on
      the map they look close by. Calculate how far away it is from where you're
      staying to the places you are visiting and decide how much driving you
      want to do per day.</p>

      <h2><strong>3. Maps:</strong></h2><p>Pay for the Alltrails Pro plan, it is
      worth it.</p><p>Before you leave for the day, download the maps of all the
      hikes you plan on doing that day because most places don't have reception
      and you can start losing reception as early as an hour away from the
      destination. Now, most places do have signs on the trail, and as long as
      you know which trails to follow you are okay, but not all have signs and
      if you don't have a map you CAN get lost!</p><p>For instance, Birthing
      Cave in Sedona has no signs and we got lost</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4.
      Plan ahead:</strong></h2><p>Thanks to Covid, Most of the people hiking in
      the US are Americans, and Americans tend to plan their trips years in
      advance so do take that into consideration when you're planning a trip,
      especially if you're traveling during the busy season. If you don't plan
      ahead it might be hard for you to find accommodation, book activities, or
      even find campgrounds available.</p><p>You can always make reservations
      with free cancelation if need be, and change plans while on the go, just
      make sure to get free cancelation up to 24 hours before your stay.</p>

      <h2><strong>5. Check the hike's level of difficulty:</strong></h2><p>When
      you decide on the hikes you want to take, find out the level of difficulty
      and prepare yourself for it. Some hikes can be short but very strenuous.
      We started training months before our trip</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>6.
      Luggage:</strong></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re planning multiple overnight pit
      stops, have a small backpack ready each time, instead of having to carry
      your whole</p><p>suitcase with you each time you</p><p>check into
      accommodation.</p>

      <h2><strong>7. Consider renting a 4x4:</strong></h2><p>If you're looking
      to explore off-road you'll need a 4x4. There are so many beautiful spots
      in Utah-Arizona that you can't get to unless you have a 4x4 so rent one
      ahead of time to save money.</p><p>You can get by with a regular car, and
      try to make it to remote areas like Moonscape Overlook in Hanksville or
      Bentonite Hills near Capitol Reef, I know of people who have done it, but
      if it rains your car probably won't be able to make it and you'll regret
      it. Plus, if you take a regular car and get into car trouble going on a
      road made for 4x4 that could be very costly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Buy an
      America is Beautiful National Park Pass</h2><p>If you're going to visit a
      few parks, or visit one for various days, it is best to buy the pass for
      80$.</p><p>Usually it costs 35$ to enter a national park.</p>

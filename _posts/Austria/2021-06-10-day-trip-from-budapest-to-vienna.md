      <h2><strong>HOW TO GET THERE:</strong></h2><p>If you're looking into a day
      trip from Budapest to Vienna, there are <strong>four options</strong> to
      do so; by train, by bus, by car, or an organized trip.</p><h3><strong>1.
      Train:</strong></h3><p>Taking the train is a great option to get from
      Budapest to Vienna it should take about 2.5 hours and costs somewhere
      between 5-22 Euro one way, which is a good bargain. Names of train
      stations: Budapest: Budapest-Kelenfoeld. Vienna: Wien Hbf There are quite
      a few options when it comes to taking a train from Budapest to
      Vienna:</p><p>&bull;<strong>Hungarian Railways (M&Aacute;V):
      </strong>Duration: 2 hours and 26 minutes. Price: 11-15 Euro. Frequency:
      the train runs hourly.<br />&bull;<strong>RegioJet: </strong>Budapest
      D&eacute;li Train Station - Prague Central Train Station WilsonovaIc.
      You'll get off at Wien Hbf, which is Vienna train station. Duration: 2
      hours and 36 minutes. Price: 10-22 Euro. Frequency: 3 times a day.<br
      />&bull;<strong>Romanian Railways (CFR): </strong>Duration: 2 hours and 40
      minutes. Price: 5-16 Euro. Frequency: twice a day.</p><p><strong>BEST
      OPTION:</strong></p><p><strong>Hungarian Railways
      (M&Aacute;V):</strong><br />&bull;Budapest-Keletito to Wien Hbf: Earliest
      train departures at 05:40 arrival at Vienna 08:21.<br />&bull;Wien Hbf to
      Budapest:<br />The last train from Vienna back to Budapest is at 21:40,
      you arrive in Budapest at 00:19 am. I recommend taking the 18:42 or the
      19:42 train from Vienna and arriving in Budapest around 21:20 or 22:20.
      That way, you have time to make it to the hotel by public transportation
      in Budapest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Bus:</strong></h3><p>Flexibus
      is the company that runs direct buses from Budapest Nepliget to Vienna
      Central Station.</p><p>The bus from Budapest to Vienna should take about 2
      hours and 50 minutes. It costs somewhere between 14-22 Euro round-trip per
      person.</p><p>The buses have outlets and free Wi-Fi. I wouldn't recommend
      it since the hours are a little restricting.</p><p>The earliest bus is at
      7:15 and takes about 2 hours and 55 minutes, meaning you <strong>arrive in
      Vienna at 10:10 and the latest bus is at 17:15,</strong> which doesn't
      give you so much time to spend in the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.
      Car:</strong></h3><p><strong>Renting a car: </strong>Renting a car is a
      great way to visit Vienna. Vienna is 243km from Budapest, so the drive
      will take about 2 hours and 23 minutes. for tips for renting a car<a
      href="http://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/renting-a-car"> click
      here!</a><br />&bull;<strong>Parking in Vienna: </strong>You can park your
      car inexpensively at <strong>Vienna's Park &amp; Ride Garages</strong> for
      about 3.60 Euros per day. All Park &amp; Ride facilities are directly
      connected to a subway line, making it easy and convenient to reach the
      city center.</p><h3><strong>4. Organized Trip:</strong></h3><p>We don't
      always take organized trips, but due to lack of time to plan and other
      elements, we considered we decided to take an organized trip. We booked
      our trip through Banai Family, a Hungarian-Israeli family who runs tours
      in Budapest; therefore, the tour is done in Hebrew and costs cheaper. If
      you'd like to book them,<a
      href="http://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/organized-day-trip-from-budapest-to-vienna">
      click here!</a><br />If you are going through a different company, there
      are many options and different tours.<br /><strong>Price:</strong> 100-180
      Euros per person.<br /><strong>What it includes:</strong> Minibus,
      Air-conditioned, lunch, small group, and excellent tour guide.<br
      /><strong>Time table:</strong><br />&bull;Schonbrunner Gardens - 30
      minutes.<br />&bull;The Hofburg - 20 minutes.<br />&bull;Sch&ouml;nbrunn
      Palace - 60 minutes.<br />&bull;Historic Center of Vienna - 40 minutes.<br
      />&bull;St. Stephen's Cathedral - 20 minutes.<br />&bull;Sch&ouml;nbrunn -
      90 minutes.</p><h2><strong>Do I recommend an organized
      trip?</strong></h2><p><strong>We enjoyed our tour.</strong> The tour guide
      was excellent and knowledgeable; we got to see all the beautiful spots in
      the city and fell in love. This is a perfect option if you're looking to
      relax and not worry about taking buses and trains and want a great tour
      guide to give you all the history and information about the city,
      including the best places to eat!</p><p>The only downfall with organized
      tours, in general, is that you can't choose the itinerary, and we would
      have loved to have been able to control how much time we gave each
      spot.</p>

      <h2><strong>ITINERARY:</strong></h2><p>If you've chosen to get to Vienna
      by train, bus, or car, here's an itinerary I built to help you.<br />Once
      you arrive at the train station in Vienna<strong> Wien Hbf</strong> Take
      the light rail D<strong> </strong>towards Absberggasse and get off at
      <strong>Maria-Theresien-Platz</strong>. The ride should take 13 minutes (7
      stops).<br />Once you arrive, get ready to walk and explore this beautiful
      city:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Maria-Theresien-Platz:</h2><p>This square is
      between two excellent museums, Art History and Natural History. The square
      is beautiful and worth visiting, you can feel Vienna's history here. the
      Statue of Empress Maria Theresia also features Mozart and Haydn.</p><p>➠
      ​​​<em>Walk 450 m (6 minutes) to....</em></p><h2>Austrian Parliament
      Building:</h2><p>Sadly, it was under construction during our visit, but we
      got to see part of it from a distance, and I was impressed by how big it
      is and the gorgeous sculptures. You can enter the Parliament building, but
      the main entrance is still under construction <em>(updated Jan 2022).
      </em><br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> <em>(When it is open)</em>
      Free.</p><p>➠<em>Walk 300 m (4 minutes)
      to....</em></p><h2>Rathauspltz:</h2><p>One of the most essential and
      beautiful squares in Vienna. Famous buildings and a small park surround
      it. It is known to be one of the most beautiful places during Christmas
      time due to its Christmas markets. We came a little later, but they still
      had the ice right and the lights set
      up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Rathaus:</h2><p>Vienna City Hall is the seat of
      the local government of Vienna, located on Rathausplatz. We loved the
      design of the building that was built in a Neo-Gothic style. and I
      recommend it to anyone visiting Vienna. We would have loved to have taken
      a tour inside but didn't have time.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> 6
      Euro per adult.<br /><strong>Guided tours:</strong> Saturdays and Sundays
      at 10.30 am. They take one hour and cost 10 Euro.<br /><strong>Opening

      minutes) to....</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Admire <strong>Burgtheater,
      Universit&auml;tsring</strong> from outside. It is the national theater of
      Austria, and it is a beauty.</p><p>➠<em>Walk 300 m (4 minutes)
      to....</em></p><h2>Volksgarten:</h2><p>The Volksgarten is a public park
      that is part of the Hofburg Palace. The park was built over the city
      fortifications that Napoleon destroyed in 1809. We enjoyed walking around
      here on our way to Hofburg. The park is spotless, has many benches,
      peaceful and quiet.<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Daily from 7:00 am to 5:30
      pm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Hofburg:</h2><p>The Hofburg is the former
      principal imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty. It was built in the
      13th century and expanded several times afterward. It also served as the
      imperial winter residence, while Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace was the summer
      residence. This palace is so impressive; the sculptures that adorn the
      surrounding area deserve your attention.<br /><strong>Entrance
      Fee</strong> Entrance to the Sisi Museum: 15 Euro for the audio guide.<br
      /><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Daily from 10 am - 5 pm.<br
      /><strong>Duration: </strong>1.5 -2 hours. For more ticket options,<a

      here!</a></p><p>➠<em>Walk 400 m (5 minutes)
      to....</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Kohlmarkt:</h2><p>We walked on Kohlmarkt -
      a historic street with upscale retailers</p><p>➠<em>Walk 600 m (8 minutes)
      to....</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>St. Stephen's Cathedral
      (Stephansdom):</h2><p>This is one of the most precious and must-visit
      cathedrals in Vienna. It is important because it is the seat of the
      Catholic Archbishop of Vienna. You will get to experience the 12th-century
      gothic architecture, the large columns, and the beautiful paintings of the
      saints. This place has 13 bells and <strong>the second largest chimed bell
      in the world</strong>. The cathedral has four towers; the tallest is the
      south tower, which provides the best view of the entire city. The tower
      room, from which there is a gigantic view across Vienna, is reached via
      343 steps<br /><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Entrance to the cathedral
      itself is Free, but if you'd like to climb to the North tower it costs 6
      Euro, and if you'd like to climb the South Tower it costs 5.50 Euro. Do
      know that there are about 343 steps.<br /><strong>Opening hours for

      the towers, you can take an elevator. For both elevators, it'll cost 16
      Euro and are both open daily from 9 am to 5:30 pm.</p><h2>Kartner Strasse
      Street:</h2><p>K&auml;rntner Stra&szlig;e is the most famous shopping
      street in central Vienna. It runs from the Stephansplatz (the square near
      Stephansdom) to the opera house. Karntner Strasse is lined with dandy
      shops, baroque cafes, and cute pathways. As you walk through the shops,
      you'll admire the incredible architecture.</p><p>➠<em>Walk 750 m (9
      minutes) to....</em></p><h2>Staasoper:</h2><p>The Staatsoper is Vienna's
      State Opera house. Built-in 1869, the Opera house has got a fascinating
      history. Between1938 to 1945, the Nazi's rule took over the opera house,
      and in 1945 the opera house was devastated during a bombing. Today, the
      Vienna State Opera is considered one of the most important opera houses in
      the world<br /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Daily from 8 am to 6 pm.<br
      /><strong>Guided tours: </strong>The tour is 40 minutes long and costs 12
      Euros per adult.<br /><strong>Covid update: </strong>For guided tours of
      the Vienna State Opera, a certificate of being recovered or vaccinated is
      required from the age of 15 - this must be shown when entering the
      building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Tip:</strong></h3><p>At the end of
      the street, just opposite the main entrance of the Opera house, there is
      an outlet souvenir shop. For example, you can buy two magnets for 4 Euro,
      and key chains for 5 Euro. (In Stephansdom, it'll cost you around 7 Euro
      for 1 magnet and 8-10 Euro for a key chain!!)<br />&nbsp;</p><p>From the
      Opera house, take the <strong>U4</strong> towards H&uuml;tteldorf and get
      off at <strong>Hietzing</strong> (the stop for Sch&ouml;nbrunn) it takes
      around 11 min (7 stops).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Schonburnn
      Palace:</strong></h2><p>Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace is one of the most visited
      places in Vienna. Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace was once the summer residence of
      Austria&rsquo;s imperial family. Today Sch&ouml;nbrunn is one of
      Europe&rsquo;s finest surviving Baroque complexes. There are two main

      tours, and the park offers many attractions. Take a stroll through the
      gardens. There is a Palm House, a Maze, a Gloriette and a famous

      <h2>Things to do in Lagos:&nbsp;</h2><p>▪︎ Surfing - There are many great
      beaches to surf in Lagos.<br />▪︎ Explore the old town of Lagos.<br />▪︎
      Sunrise or sunset at Ponte da Piedade - this famous headland shows off a
      group of rock formations consisting of yellow-golden clifflike rocks
      standing up to 20 meters high.<br />There&rsquo;s a free car park right by
      the headland so it&rsquo;s super easy to jump out if you&rsquo;re pushed
      for time. I would also highly recommend exploring more of the coastline
      here, don&rsquo;t just limit yourself to getting &lsquo;that shot&rsquo;
      and leaving. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous area to walk around and even more so at
      sunrise with a coffee or sunset with a bottle of wine!<br />▪︎Take a boat
      tour to Benagil cave, Dolphin-Watching, or Ponte da Piedade caves.<br />▪︎
      Visit the beaches: There are many beautiful beaches such as Meia Praia,
      Porto do Mos, Praia Da Luz, Tonel, Sagres, Praia da Arrifana, Praia do
      Amado.<br />▪︎Explore Western Algarve: Visit Butgau, Segres, and Costa
      Vicentina.</p>

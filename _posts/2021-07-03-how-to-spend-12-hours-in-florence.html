  title: How to spend 12 Hours in Florence
  description: >-
    Since we had 8 full days in Rome we decided to go venture outside of the
    city. We decided to visit Florence since it is not too far from Rome and we
    absolutely fell in love with the capital city of Tuscany.

      <h2>WHEN TO VISIT:</h2><p><br />The best time to visit is during the
      shoulder season when there are less tourists and the weather isn't too
      bad. The peak season is mid-June through August, shoulder season is April
      through mid-June and September through October.&nbsp;<br />Florence
      weather in May is quite enjoyable with up to 11 hours of sunshine per day
      and 15 hours of daylight. The average temperature is 16&deg;C, which is a
      little chilly so bring warm clothes with you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><strong>TRAIN FROM ROME TO FLORENCE:</strong></h2><p>We decided to
      take the bullet train from Rome to Florence since it is faster than
      renting a car and driving to Florence. The bullet train goes up to 280
      KPH. The earlier you book your tickets the cheaper it is. You could get
      tickets for real cheap if you buy them 4-6 months before your trip. We
      didn&rsquo;t know so and booked our tickets 2 months in advance and that
      is why the price was so high. It is also important to buy the tickets back
      and forth.</p><ul><li><strong>Route:</strong> Termini Station (the station
      in Rome) to Santa Maria Novela (the stop in
      Florence).</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 64 USD per
      person.</li><li><strong>Tickets:</strong> Print out your tickets that way
      you get a bar code and just scan it through the machines and don&rsquo;t
      have to wait in line to convert your order into tickets in the
      booths.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> The train has very comfortable
      seats and outlets to charge your phone so relax and enjoy the beautiful
      view of Tuscany as you pass them on the train.</li><li><strong>To order

      <h2><strong>WHEN YOU SHOULD GO:</strong></h2><p>Since it takes a 1 hour
      and 40 minutes train ride, we decided to take the 7 AM train so we could
      arrive at Piazzale Michelangelo at around 9 am and enjoy the beautiful
      view before the crowds come. We wanted to make the most out of our day in
      Florence so we decided to book the 9 pm train back to Rome so that gave us
      a great amount of time to enjoy the
      city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong>:</h2><p>When you
      exit the train station in Florence you will see a machine on your left
      that you could buy bus tickets. It&rsquo;s about 1.5$ for a bus fair for
      90 minutes. We then crossed the street and took the a bus to Piazzale
      Michelangelo. The bus drops you off right there and from there we walked
      everywhere.</p>

      <h2><strong>OUR ROUTE:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Piazzale
      Michelangelo</strong></h3><p>There is nothing better than starting your
      trip in Florence with the most beautiful view of the city from this
      balcony. If you can, best come for sunrise or sunset! There is a copy of
      the statue of David over there but the original one is in the Accademia
      Museum.</p>

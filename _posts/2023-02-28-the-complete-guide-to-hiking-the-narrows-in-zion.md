It is best to go in at least 3 miles up to Wall Street.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Shuttles:</strong></h2><p>The shuttles run regularly from March through November, on weekends in February, and the last week in December. Zion Canyon Scenic Drive (the road that starts north of Canyon Junction) is closed to private vehicles when park shuttles are operating. Shuttles can arrive at the stops every seven minutes during the busiest days.</p><p>The first shuttle from the Visitors Center starts at 6:00 am, they are free, and you'll take it to the last stop called \"Temple of Sinawava (the ride will take about 40 mins).</p><p>•Parking at the Visitor Center is limited and if you arrive after 9:00 am you'll probably have to park in Springdale and walk or take a shuttle to the Visitor Center.</p>"

    textarea_html: "<h2><strong>How to beat the crowds:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>•The further you hike in, the fewer people there will be. We went in 3 miles and there weren't that many people.</p><p>•Start EARLY! The best time to start is around 8-11 am. We headed back at around 12 pm and we saw the amounts of people just arriving and it was crazy!</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>Safety:</strong></h2><p>• There are cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the Virgin River &amp; Zion streams. The park monitors monthly for the presence of harmful cyanobacteria and advises you to wash off immediately, not to drink water, or touch your mouth or face after touching the water in the streams.</p><p>• Make sure there are no flash flood warnings, it can be very dangerous.</p><p>\_</p><h2><strong>How to prepare for the hike:</strong></h2><p><strong>• Dress like you will get wet: </strong>because you will! We brought our own water shoes, but you can definitely wear an old pair of sneakers or rent some shoes nearby outside the park.</p><p>• Rent Equipment: &nbsp;</p>"

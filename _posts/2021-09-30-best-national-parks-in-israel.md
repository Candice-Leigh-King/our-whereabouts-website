      <h2><strong>BEIT GUVRIN CAVES</strong></h2><p>Beit Guvrin is not only a
      national park but also a UNESCO world heritage site Located not too far
      from Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fairly large complex, which includes
      about 5 different sites with the main ones being Tel Maresha, Maresha
      caves, The northern city complex, and the reconstructed ancient wine press
      and olive press.</p><p>The highlight is the caves that are spectacular in
      beauty but apart from the caves the area is very beautiful and there are
      great trails, beautiful ruins, and interesting history.</p><h3>Things you
      should know before you go:</h3><ul><li>Admission costs: Adult $
      7.5</li><li>Transportation: Because the compound is large inside, you
      travel by car from place to place and park near each site.</li><li>When
      entering you get a very understandable map to use.</li><li>The site is
      open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</li><li>it is recommended to arrive
      in the middle of the week, early from a place to enjoy it
      properly.</li><li>in winter, the place is much greener but it should be
      taken into account that the caves close for safety reasons, so it is
      recommended to check before if the caves open.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>MITZPEH RAMON:</strong></h2><p>Mitzprh Ramon is the viewpoint
      where you can see the Maktesh Ramon - the largest erosion crater in the
      world!</p><p>We always enjoy visiting this place on the way down south of
      Israel.</p><p>This is a unique place you don't want to
      miss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Things to know before you
      go:</h4><ul><li>︎Entrance fee: &bull; If you want to just enjoy the view
      it is free you can walk around. &bull; For 8.4$ (kids costs 4$) you can go
      into the Mitzpeh Ramon visitor Crater which tells the geological story of
      the formation of the makhtesh, the largest landform of its type in the
      world. As part of the exhibition is the Ilan Ramon Memorial, telling the
      story of Israel&rsquo;s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon who died in the 2003
      Colombia Disaster, and loved the Ramon Crater and surrounding desert area.
      I recommend this for first-timers!</li><li>︎Fun tip - there are mountain
      goats all around there, they are used to people and will come up close. I
      usually pack some carrots and feed them</li><li>︎My best tip, go during
      sunrise or sunset!!! With a view like this, a sunrise/sunset can add so
      much</li></ul>

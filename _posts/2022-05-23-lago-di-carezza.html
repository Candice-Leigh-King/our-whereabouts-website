      <h3><strong>The legend:</strong></h3><p>Once upon a time, there was a
      mermaid living in the lake. The wizard Masar&eacute; was in love with her.
      In order to seduce her, he followed the advice of the witch Lanwerda to
      dress up as a jewel merchant and to throw a rainbow between the Mt
      Catinaccio and Mt Latemar. The wizard did this, but he forgot to dress up
      as a jewel merchant. The beautiful mermaid realized that he was a wizard
      and disappeared in the lake. In sadness the wizard then threw the rainbow
      and all the jewels into the lake. That&rsquo;s why the lake still features
      such beautiful colors.</p>

  description: >-
    Our first stop in the Dolomites was Lago di Carezza. Lago di Carezza, aka,
    Karersee in German, is a small alpine lake and is known for its wonderful
    colors and view of mount Latermar. It is one of the most beautiful lakes in
    the Dolomites and should be on your itinerary when visiting.

      <h3><strong>Some History:</strong></h3><p>This lake is about 240 million
      years old. The whole area was once under sea.</p><p>The lake is known as
      Rainbow lake because of it's beautiful colors and the legend behind the
      lake.</p>

      <h3><strong>The legend:</strong></h3><p>Once upon a time, there was a
      mermaid living in the lake. The wizard Masar&eacute; was in love with her.
      In order to seduce her, he followed the advice of the witch Lanwerda to
      dress up as a jewel merchant and to throw a rainbow between the Mt
      Catinaccio and Mt Latemar. The wizard did this, but he forgot to dress up
      as a jewel merchant. The beautiful mermaid realized that he was a wizard
      and disappeared in the lake. In sadness the wizard then threw the rainbow
      and all the jewels into the lake. That&rsquo;s why the lake still features
      such beautiful colors.</p>

      <h3><strong>When to visit:</strong></h3><p>In our opinion, the best time
      to visit Lago di Carezza is in shoulder season (April-May and
      September-October), when the weather is still warm, the water high enough,
      and isn't as populated.</p><p>Sunrise and sunset are both magical times to
      visit Lago di Carezza. We tried for sunset..... But the weather was
      horrible.</p>

      <h3><strong>Parking:</strong></h3><p>The parking lot is pretty cheap and
      brings you straight to the beautiful small lake. The first 15 minutes are
      free, One hour costs 1 Euro, 2 hours costs 2 Euro, And 2-6 hours cost 4
      Euro.</p>

      <h3><strong>How to get there:</strong></h3><p>Obviously, the easiest way
      is by car but you could also take a bus from Bolzano to Val di Fassa and
      stop right at Lago di Carezza parking lot. How awesome is that?</p>

      <h3><strong>Walking around:</strong></h3><p>There's a small walking
      circular trail around the lake that takes about 20 minutes. It's a
      beautiful walk through the Latermar forest that surrounds the lake.
      It&rsquo;s a easy walk with a few great lookout points to view from
      different angles.</p>

      <h3><strong>Swimming:</strong></h3><p>Swimming here is not allowed since
      the lake is a protected natural landmark and fenced all around. Climbing
      the fence is prohibited. Why am I mentioning this? Many people climb the
      fence, take their awesome Instagram shots with the big rock without
      realizing <strong>this is prohibited and violators will be
      FINED!</strong></p>

      <h3><strong>Food:</strong></h3><p>There&rsquo;s a restaurant and a

      reasonably priced.</p>

      <h2>Our photos don't do justice to how beautiful this place really is. We
      had bad weather and since we came from Venice where it was hot, we weren't
      prepared for this weather but trust me when I tell you that this lake must
      be on your list!</h2>

      <h4><strong>When to visit:</strong></h4><p>The best time is in the
      shoulder season (April-May and September-October), when the weather is
      still warm enough and isn't as touristy.</p>

      <p><strong>3. HISTORY</strong></p><p>Hermit monks first climbed these
      soaring rocks to settle in the caves and hollows of the rocks as early as
      the 9th century. During the time of the Turkish occupation, the Hermit
      monks climbed higher and higher up the rock face until they were living on
      the peaks where they were able to build by bringing materiel and people up
      by ladders and baskets.</p><p>The first monastery that was built on a
      summit dates to the 14th century, when Athanasios Koinovitis, a monk from
      Mount Athos, ascended and built the first structure, the Great
      Meteoron.</p>

      <p><strong>4. HOW IT WAS FORMED</strong></p><p>About 60 million years ago,
      a series of earth movements pushed the seabed upwards, creating a high
      plateau and causing many vertical fault lines in the thick layer of
      sandstone.</p><p>The rocks are made from sandstone and conglomerate
      rocks.</p>

      <p><strong>7. TAKING ROCKS HOME</strong></p><p>Do not take rocks home with
      you! This is a sacred place and Greece has strict laws to protect its
      hundreds of antiquity sites. <strong>It is illegal to own, buy, sell or
      excavate antiquities</strong>, and items found accidentally must be handed
      over to authorities.</p>

      <p><strong>8. DRESS CODE</strong></p><p>To enter the monasteries of
      Meteora a dress code is enforced. <strong>Men must wear long pants and
      women, long skirts</strong>. Sleeveless shirts are not allowed. You can
      bring a scarf and wrap it around your waist but if you don't have one
      don't worry, in some monasteries, they have skirts you could take at the
      entrance to monasteries, but some will make you buy a scarf for 6 EURO if
      you don't have a scarf or sweater to wrap around.</p>

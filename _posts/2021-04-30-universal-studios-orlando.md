      <h2><strong>WHERE TO STAY ON A BUDGET:</strong></h2><p><strong>Westgate
      Towers Resort </strong>☆☆☆☆ 225 NIS per night<br />We stayed for five
      nights.<br />It&rsquo;s a nice, cute hotel, but we were never there! We
      were so busy waking up early to the parks and coming back after midnight
      every night. You don&rsquo;t need the best hotel. You just need a good,
      comfortable hotel close to the parks.-minute drive and just a 27-minute
      drive to Universal Studios.</p><h2><strong>PRICES:</strong></h2><p>We did
      2 days each day 232$ (797 NIS) for both of us. One day per park. Universal
      studios have two parks. If you ask me which one is better, I can not
      answer that! I love them both
      equally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
      APP:</strong></h2><p>It's always great to have the universal app that way
      you can see how long of a wait there is for each ride. Also, you can see
      the hours for the shows and parades.</p><h2><strong>WHEN TO
      VISIT:</strong></h2><p>This is important! Make sure to go on a weekday and
      not a weekend. On top of it, make sure to go while kids are back in school
      and not during a holiday or summer vacation. We went on Tuesday and
      Wednesday, the 1st week of school in Orlando, and the longest we waited in
      line was 25 minutes!!!!!! We rode all the rides and even did a few
      twice.</p><h2><strong>THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS:</strong></h2><p>The ride
      connects the original Wizarding World (set in Hogsmeade and located in
      Islands of Adventure) with Diagon Alley, over in Universal Studios
      Florida. The train itself is a ride, and people say it's incredible, but
      you must have a two-park ticket to ride it which costs 55$ more per
      person, and for us, that just wasn't worth it to pay for one ride 55$ per
      person!</p><h2><strong>FOOD:</strong></h2><p>Be prepared, the park is
      expensive. A small personal pizza with a small salad + a chicken sandwich
      is 32$ (110 NIS)</p><h2><strong>OUR TOP TIP:</strong></h2><p>Florida is
      HOT! if you are going to Universal for a few days it's SO worth it to get
      their refill cups. It&rsquo;s the best way to deal with heat since you
      could also refill the cups with slush. Universal offers the new Coke
      Freestyle refillable cup program the cost $12.99. Guests can quench their
      thirst in over 100 different ways when they purchase a Coke Freestyle cup.
      Once you do, you&rsquo;ll get unlimited FREE refills at any Coke Freestyle
      station at either theme park for the day. If you already have a cup, extra
      days are only $6.</p><h2><strong>UNIVERSAL CITYWALK:</strong></h2><p>They
      have great stores around, and food such as Cold stone, Panda Express and
      the best is Voodoo Doughnuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>VOODOO
      DOUGHNUTS:</strong></h3><p>They have a vast variety of special donuts you
      can't find anywhere else. The only other store is universal studios walk
      in LA.</p>

      <h2><strong>ISLAND OF ADVENTURE PARK:</strong></h2><p>This park has the
      Harry Potter Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Hogwarts is a ride, so even if you
      have to wait in line, it's cool since you enjoy going around the
      castle.</p><ul><li>Get yourself a butterbeer its 7$ for a large cup.
      It&rsquo;s pretty great!!!!!</li><li>They also have candies from the harry
      potter movies and cool things.</li><li>Jurassic Park ride &amp; King Kong
      &ndash; These rides are classics. If you can do King Kong twice, make sure
      to sit on the left side of the car once, and the second time sit on the
      right! That way you get to enjoy the effects.&nbsp;</li><li>Spiderman was
      one of our favorites!! We did it twice!</li><li>The hulk is the most
      fantastic ride ever!!! As a thrill seeker, this ride was shocking! Loved
      it!</li><li>Dudley Do-Right&rsquo;s Ripsaw Falls - You must put all your
      belongings in a locker because you get soaked from head to toe!</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>UNIVERSAL STUDIOS PARK:</strong></h2><p>This park has Diegon
      Ally and Gringotts bank and the cool dragon on top which breathes fire
      every once and a while it is remarkable. Harry Potter and the Escape from
      Gringotts - the ride is so good. We road it twice in a row!</p><ul><li>The
      Mummy is a classic fantastic ride</li><li>The Men in black, E.T adventure,
      the Simpsons &ndash; fun classic rides for everyone.</li><li>Minions ride
      - This ride is popular and usually has a very long queue. Use the app and
      try to go when less crowded.</li><li>Transformers - AMAZING!!! Don't miss
      it!</li><li>Rip Ride Rockit - The seat has speakers behind your ears, and
      when you get on the ride, you can choose a song you want to hear! I LOVED
      this ride so much that I did it twice in a row!</li></ul>

      recommend you visit both. If you're in Orlando and looking to visit

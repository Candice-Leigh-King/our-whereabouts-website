      April)<br />&bull;Shoulder seasons (July and August)<br />&bull;Low season
      (May, June, and September through early November)<br />&bull;We went to
      Mexico in September. We spent 22 days in Mexico and it only rained during
      2 of those days.&nbsp;</p><h1>Duration of stay:</h1><p>Honestly, Mexico is
      so large and has so much to offer. You could spend a week there, and you
      could also spend 2 months. We stayed for 22 days and did plenty, but we
      would have loved another week at least!</p><h1>Our
      Itinerary:</h1><p>&bull;𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑢𝑛 ⇾ 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑎 𝐷𝑒𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑛.<br

      <h1>Our top tips:</h1><p><strong>1. Book hotels &amp; flights as soon as
      possible:</strong><br />In Mexico, the earlier you book your hotel, the
      cheaper they will be.</p><p><strong>2. Always book a hotel with a
      safe:</strong><br />It is so important to put your valuables in the safe.
      Sadly we heard that hotel workers shouldn't be trusted in Mexico and steal
      even things like makeup. We made sure to put all our valuables in the safe
      and even locked our suitcases when we left for the day.</p><p><strong>3.
      Leave your passport in the safe:</strong><br />There are so many
      pickpocketers in Mexico, and the chance of you losing your passport is
      higher if it is on you. Carry an ID or copy of your passport that should
      be enough.</p><p><strong>4. Tell hotels that you are on your
      honeymoon:</strong><br />If you are on your honeymoon, tell the hotels
      ahead of time. They will decorate your room, and some hotels will even
      give you champagne and dessert.</p><p><strong>5. What clothes to
      bring:</strong><br />Bring clothes that you don't mind ruining. You're
      going to be spending so much time in the ocean and we all know that the
      ocean salts ruin our clothes. Make sure to pack a few nice outfits for
      when you go out to a party or a fancy restaurant.</p><p><strong>6. Credit
      cards:</strong><br />Always fly with 2 credit cards just in case you lose
      one. One of them should be on you, and one should stay in the
      safe.</p><p><strong>7. Cash:</strong><br />Always have small change on you
      (5-10 Pesos) because in Mexico is acceptable to give tips, and it's always
      more comfortable when you have it ready.</p><p><strong>8.
      Bank:</strong><br />We recommend<strong><em> pulling out money only from
      banks ATM! </em></strong>When we visited Cibanco had the lowest exchange
      rate.</p><p><strong>9. Mosquito repellent:</strong><br />Don't bring
      mosquito repellent from home! Mexico has mosquitos everywhere, but don't
      worry, they also have the best mosquito repellent called 'OFF'. The orange
      bottle has an orange smell, and the moment we started using it, we never
      got bit by mosquitos.</p><p><strong>10. Cost of taxis:<br
      />​​​​​</strong>There's a simple rule - How much does it cost to take a
      taxi? A 1-minute drive costs about 10 Pesos. Use Google maps to calculate
      the ride time.</p>

      <p><strong>11. Tap water:</strong><br />You're not allowed to drink tap
      water in Mexico. When you're brushing your teeth use mineral water, and
      when you are at the restaurant, ask not to have ice cubes in your
      drinks.</p><p><strong>12. Watch what you eat:</strong><br />To avoid food
      poisoning/salmonella, don't eat from the food stalls outside. Try to eat
      in restaurants that are full of people that way, you'll know that the
      turnover of the food is higher and the food is fresher.</p><p><strong>13.
      Waterproof bag:</strong><br />Bring a waterproof bag when going to the
      beach. You put your valuables in there, including your phone, and that
      way, you don't have to worry about your valuables getting
      stolen.</p><p><strong>14. Where to exchange money:</strong><br />Always
      exchange your USD or pull out Pesos in the big cities (Cancun/Playa del
      Carmen) because in small places (like Holbox or Bacalar), it is very hard
      to find bank ATMs, and when you do find them, the exchange rates are
      higher.</p><p><strong>15. If you rent a car:</strong><br />Make sure to
      drive within the speed limit! <strong>The police there
      </strong><strong>are</strong><strong> corrupt,</strong> and they look for
      tourists to take a bribe instead of getting a speeding
      ticket!</p><p><strong>16. USD Vs. Peso: </strong><br />If you are asked if
      you want to pay by Peso or USD, always choose Peso because the exchange
      rate is always higher with USD.</p><p><strong>17. Rainy days:</strong><br
      />Beware, on rainy days, there will be way more mosquitos outside! Use the
      OFF mosquito repellent, or they'll eat you alive!</p><p><strong>18. Bring
      Portable Chargers:</strong><br />These definitely come in handy when you
      are out all day exploring.</p><p><strong>19. Transportation:</strong><br
      />Getting around Mexico is very useful by bus. The buses are very
      comfortable and even have movies playing. <em><strong>The number of seats
      is limited therefore you should order the tickets ahead of time
      online!</strong></em></p><p><strong>20. Warm clothes:</strong><br />Always
      bring warm clothes when taking buses. It gets very cold because of the
      AC.</p>

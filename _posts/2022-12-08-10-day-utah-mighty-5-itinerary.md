      <h2>Day 1 - Monument Valley:</h2><p>Monument Valley isn&rsquo;t exactly
      close to any major city. If you're on a road trip like us here are the
      most convenient ways to get to Monument Valley:</p><p>&bull;Page, Arizona
      - 125 miles<br />‚Äã‚Äã&bull;Grand Canyon (South Rim) - 178 miles<br
      />&bull;Phoenix Airport - 320 miles<br />‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã&bull;Albuquerque Airport -
      324 miles<br />&bull;Las Vegas Airport - 400 miles</p><p>Arrive at
      Monument Valley, pay 8$ per person to enter the Navajo Tribal park and
      drive the 17-mile loop.<br />Make sure not to miss these spots:The wildcat
      trail, The Mittens &amp; Merrick Butte, The Tree Sisters, Jon Ford's
      Point, Totem Pole, Artist's Point.</p><p>Then head on to Forrest Gump
      Point - This is the most famous spot. It's best to visit this spot in the
      morning or early afternoon because, in the late afternoon and early
      evening, you'll be facing the sun. The speed limit on this road is low,
      but it's still important to watch for cars because this road gets busy,
      especially in the afternoon.</p><p>You'll finish your day at The Mexican
      Hat is a weird and cool natural formation located outside of the formal
      park.</p><p><strong><em>‚á¢ Drive 3 hours to Moab<br />üè®Sleep in:

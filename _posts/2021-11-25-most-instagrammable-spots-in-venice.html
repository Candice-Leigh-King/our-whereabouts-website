      <h2><strong>1. San Marco at sunrise</strong></h2><p>We woke up early to
      catch the sunrise at St. Mark's Square. It is one of the most popular
      spots in the city therefore arrive early to beat the crowds. There is
      something extremely romantic and beautiful about watching the sunrise
      here.</p>

      <h2><strong>2. Rialto bridge</strong></h2><p>You'll walk another 450m and
      reach the magnificent Ponte di Rialto. There are many ways to admire this
      bridge.</p><h3><br />Coordinations to this spot:</h3><p><br />45.4384198,
      12.3359621</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Libreria Acqua
      Alta</strong></h2><p>The most unique bookstore you'll ever visit. The
      magic starts the moment you enter. You'll find hidden gems all around,
      friendly cats everywhere, a gondola in the middle of the store and at the
      end of it is a photo op. Opening hours: Daily, 9 AM &ndash; 7:45
      PM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. Bridge of Sighs</strong></h2><p>There
      are four ways you can see this magnificent bridge.</p><p>There are 4
      different angles where you can capture a photo with this
      bridge:</p><ul><li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Ponte della Paglia: It's a
      bridge right next to St. Mark's square and just behind the Doge's
      Palace.</li><li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Below Ponte della Pagila (in
      photo): When facing the Bridge of Sighs walk to your right off the bridge
      and make a left turn to an alley for this cool spot in this
      photo.</li><li><strong>Option 3:</strong> The bridge near Trattoria
      Canonica&rlm; restaurant.</li><li><strong>Option 4:</strong> Gondola ride.
      This is a great option, but an expensive one. (Most expensive
      option..)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>5. Basilica di San
      Marco</strong></h2><p>We booked and reserved a spot online to enter the
      basilica ahead of time. You can make a reservation online starting in
      April until November. The rest of the months the que isn't too bad so you
      can't preorder tickets. We recommend you go inside if possible, it is
      beautiful.</p><ul><li>Entrance fee: 3 Euro per adult.</li><li>Opening
      hours: Daily 9:35 AM &ndash; 5:00 PM.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>6.
      Hidden pier near Hotel San Moise</strong></h2><p>This small pier is an
      Instagram famous spot that has no name. To get here you need to enter
      'Hotel San Moise' into google maps. The pier gives you a wonderful view of
      Calle Dario la Chiesa bridge and if you don't know about this spot, you'll
      probably miss it because it isn't noticeable.</p><h2><strong>7. Scala
      Contarini del Bovolo</strong></h2><p>Not far is Palazzo Contarini del
      Bovolo. It is a small palazzo in Venice, best known for its external
      multi-arch spiral staircase with a spectacular view of the city. Don't
      forget to buy tickets ahead of time!</p><ul><li>Entrance Fee: 7
      Euro.</li><li>Opening hours: Every day, 10:00 AM to 18:00 PM.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>8. Burano</strong></h2><p>Located 50 minutes away from Venice
      are two islands you shouldn't miss during your visit. It's a charming
      place, with a calmer pace than Venice where you are able to get away from
      the crowds. It is a group of islands within the Venice district that are
      made up of several small islands connected together by a series of canals
      and bridges, similar to Venice.</p><p>For a blog post about this place<a

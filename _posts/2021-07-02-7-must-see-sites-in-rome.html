  title: 7 must-see sites in Rome
  description: >-
    There's a reason why Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world.
    Renowned as the birthplace of the mouth-watering Gelato and the home to the
    Colosseum, the eternal city of Rome offers so much. We love the history,
    food, culture, and exquisite architecture found at every corner, which makes
    it one of the most unique cities we have been to. Rome has so much to offer
    but here are seven sites you must see while visiting.

      <h2><strong>HOW LONG TO STAY:</strong></h2><p>Most people go to Meteora
      for a day but we recommend you go for at least 2 days and here's
      why:</p><ul><li>The drive to Meteora from Thessaloniki/Athens takes about
      3-4 hours by the time you get there you'll have only a few hours to really
      enjoy it since you probably won't want to drive in the
      dark.</li><li>Sunsets and sunrises here are definitely worth seeing here
      if you're around.</li><li>If you want to properly enjoy the monasteries
      and the view they have to offer you'll need more than a day.</li><li>You
      won't be able to see all 6 monasteries in one day, you'll be able to see
      maybe 4. If you're going to make it all the way to Meteora it's a shame
      not to get to see all of them. They are very unique.</li><li>You can
      explore Kalabaka and Trikla the towns below Meteora.</li><li>Go to
      wineries - They have some really great wineries around
      Meteora.</li><li>Gives you time to explore Meteora and find hidden gems
      like this spot in the photo.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>WHEN TO VISIT:</strong></h2><p>The best time to visit is in
      late spring (March to May) or autumn (September to November) when the
      crowds are less hectic.</p><p>We visited in the
      winter.</p><h3><strong>Here's why you should consider visiting in the
      winter:</strong></h3><p>1. Beat the crowds: In winter, the mainland sites
      are practically deserted, allowing you to explore and experience the
      monasteries all to yourself. Meteora isn't as much of a secret these days
      thanks to social media and during the summer you'll see a line of buses
      filled with tourists that come to visit the monasteries on a day trip from
      Athens or Thessaloniki. You'll see that in our photos we are ALL ALONE not
      because we edited people out of our photos, but because we really had
      Meteora all to ourselves.</p><p>2. Great Weather: Greek winter weather can
      be downright warm. Yes, in the northern region it could snow or rain but
      the temperature shouldn't be too bad if you're lucky. We visited a week
      after a snowstorm and during the morning and night it was freezing (6c)
      but mid-day it was sunny and warm.</p><p>3. Cheap: When you travel
      off-season you also get to enjoy off-season prices which always helps save
      up for the next trip!</p><h3><strong>Cons:</strong></h3><p>If the weather
      isn't great you might experience low visibility, the monastery stairs and
      bridges might be slippery if wet from rain and some might even be
      closed.</p>

      <h2><strong>WHERE TO STAY:</strong></h2><p>The monasteries are located
      just north of the small town of Kalamb&aacute;ka, south of the village of
      Kastraki, and east of the Pindus (P&iacute;ndos)</p><h2><strong>WHAT TO
      PACK:</strong></h2><ul><li>modest dress / long skirts or a
      shawl</li><li>cash (entrance fee 3 euro)</li><li>comfortable
      shoes</li><li>hat</li><li>sunglasses</li><li>an extra layer since it gets
      chilly in the early morning/late evening.</li><li>Snacks and water - there
      is nothing in the area.</li></ul><h2><strong>TAP
      WATER:</strong></h2><p>Tap water is drinkable in all cities of Greece. The
      same is true for the tap water of Meteora. You may want to ask locals if
      they recommend drinking tap water.</p><p>The best time to visit the
      Meteora monasteries is during the spring and autumn. It's better to start
      your day early in the morning. Tourist buses arrive between 10:30 and
      11:00, so you might want to be there
      sooner.</p><h2><strong>DRIVING:</strong></h2><p>Everything you need to
      know about renting a car in Northern Greece:</p><ul><li>When we landed at
      the airport the car rental agent recommended we take a big car since it
      isn't "easy" to drive to Meteora. We took the risk with an Automatic
      Toyota Aygo and we got along without any problems.</li><li>The drive from
      Thessaloniki isn't too difficult, even though we heard some people compare
      it to the drive in the Dolomites (Italy). From our experience, if we had
      to compare driving in the Dolomites to Meteora, Meteora was a piece of
      cake.</li><li>We recommend using the toll roads since it isn't so
      expensive, easy to use and the roads are great.</li><li>We used Waze to
      get around and found it to work perfectly.</li><li>Car rental cost per
      day: 38.2 Euro (including rental car insurance)</li><li>Gas cost in total:
      we spent 77 Euro (for 4 days)</li><li>We rented our car from Budget and we
      were very happy with the service.</li></ul>

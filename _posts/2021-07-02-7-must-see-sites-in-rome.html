      <h2><strong>1. THE PANTHEON:</strong></h2><p>The Pantheon (Latin:
      Pantheum) in Rome is a former Roman temple that was completed in 125 CE.
      It is the only ancient Roman building that has remained intact throughout
      the centuries. Built on the site of an earlier temple, Marcus Agrippa was
      commissioned during the reign of Augustus. It was then rebuilt by the
      emperor Hadrian.</p><p>Here are a few interesting facts about the
      Pantheon:<br />&bull;It is about 2,000 years old.<br />&bull;The building
      was built with a huge 45 meters dome - an amazing architectural
      achievement for the days of ancient Rome. The dome's weight is 4,535
      tonnes!<br />&bull;It was the first temple built for the "common people,"
      which was <strong>uncommon</strong>. Temples in ancient times were for
      priests.<br />&bull;The name "Pantheon" is from the Ancient Greek meaning
      "all the gods"<br />&bull;The huge Pantheon dome has been the largest in
      the world for 1300 years and, to this day is the largest dome in the
      world.<br />&bull;An amazing effect can be seen each year on <strong>April
      21 </strong>when the sun's rays enter the oculus and create a disk of
      light at the entrance of the doorway. Rome's birthday is celebrated on
      April 21, and it is believed that on that day, Emperor Hadrian wanted to
      stand at the temple entrance, with his body bathed in golden sunlight, as
      if the gods were calling him from above to join
      them.</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong> Free.<br /><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Every day, 9:00 am to 7:00 pm (last entry 6:30 pm).</p>

      <h2><strong>2. THE COLOSSEUM, ROMAN FORUM &amp; PALATINE
      HILL:</strong></h2><p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center
      of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the
      largest ancient amphitheater ever built and is still the largest standing
      amphitheater in the world today, despite its age. It is one of the World's
      Wonders and DEFINITELY worth visiting once in a lifetime. As you spend
      time in the Colosseum, you feel like you've goen back in time. The
      decision to purchase tickets for the "full tour" that included not only
      the arena floor (regular entrance fee) but also a Panoramic view and
      underground view with a small group including a great tour guide, was a
      wise choice and money well spent. The extra cost allowed us backstage,
      where the exotic animals and gladiators were brought to the arena.<br
      />The Arena - Regular entrance gives you access to the main arena, one of
      the important parts of the Colosseum, where games, battles, and shows take
      place.<br />The underground - Venture into the arena and the underground
      tunnels where gladiators and wild animals awaited to fight.<br />Panoramic
      Terrence - you can admire the Colosseum from its most impressive point of
      view and get amazing photos!</p><p><strong>Entrance Fee: </strong><br
      />&bull; Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 18 EURO per adult.<br
      />&bull; Skip-the-Line Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill Tour - 30 EURO
      per adult.<br />&bull; Colosseum Underground, Arena, Panoramic Terrence,
      Roman Forum &amp; Hill Tour - 60 EURO per adult. (What we took). This tour
      is 2-3 hours. <em>It's possible to access the Colosseum only at the time
      chosen during the booking phase, and it's suggested to show up at the
      entrance 15 minutes before the chosen time. The entrance to the Colosseum
      is located at the "Sperone Valadier", near the Arch of
      Constantine.</em><br /><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Every day. Last
      admission one hour before closing.<br />&bull;January 2nd-February 28th,
      2022: From 9:30 am to 4:30 pm.<br />&bull;March 1st-26th, 2022: From 9:30

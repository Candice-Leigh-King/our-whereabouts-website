      <h2><strong>Here are some of our top tips:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Rent a
      small car -</strong></h3><p>This is the best tip we can give you Driving
      through narrow windy roads in the day or night is much easier with a small
      car.</p><p>It was just the two of us, one big suitcase and two backpacks.
      If you're a big family and need a bigger car it IS
      DOABLE!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Always add more time to what Waze says
      -</strong></h3><p>I love Waze but Waze is only as good as the information
      you provide .Waze relies on users to report road conditions (accidents,
      traffic) plus it does not take into account traffic lights, potentially
      slowing down arrival time. Refresh your destination the morning of your
      departure with enough time for waze recallobrate itself</p><p>Plus you'll
      see such beautiful views that you'll want to stop and take
      photos</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Beware of toll roads
      -</strong></h3><p>The fastest way from Venice to the Dolomites by car is
      via the A4/E70 and A22/E45 which are <strong>toll highways</strong>. We
      used Waze choosing the options of roads without tolls because we heard
      that you need to pre-pay for the toll-roads. Finding these toll stands as
      a tourist is not easy which will result in receiving a fine once they
      return back from their trip.</p><p>We also heard that it is hard to
      understand which lanes are for subscribers and which for the one-time
      users.<em> </em>ùë™ùíêùíèùíî: Takes longer.</p><p>ùë∑ùíìùíêùíî:Scenic route has
      the best views.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Speed limit
      -</strong></h3><p>The speed in Italy, generally is not proportional, for
      example, on the highway you can see a speed of 50 km but than on the WINDY
      road you can see a speed mark of 80 km?! However, it is very important to
      drive according to the speed limit since Italy is highly networked with
      speed cameras everywhere and they are <strong>looking</strong> to give out
      speeding tickets. You'll see the locals speeding next to you, but they
      probably know exactly where the cameras are located, so don't risk it, if
      there are rows of cars behind you, don't fret, simply yield to the side if
      possible and let everyone pass. The turtle won the race
      anyway!!!</p><h3><strong>Gas stations -</strong></h3><p>The gas stations
      in Italy were pretty odd. You can't find a convenient store at the gas
      stations so if you'd like a snack don't rely on the gas stops.</p>

      <h2><strong>Tips for renting a car:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Booking car
      rental -</strong></h3><p>You should rent the car as early as possible,
      prices go up as you get closer to the date of
      travel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Automatic vehicle VS. Manual vehicle
      -</strong></h3><p>It should be taken into account that an automatic
      vehicle costs much more than a manual vehicle, sometimes twice the
      amount., Yet, driving through the mountains manually, is not always easy
      for those who are either inexperienced or uncomfortable with manual. Take
      that into consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Car type
      -</strong></h3><p>You do not necessarily get the car you order but of
      similar class. What do I mean? For example, we ordered a FIAT PANDA but we
      got a DACIA, a set of similar vehicles of the same size but it is not the
      car we ordered. That's how it is at car rental
      agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Prices -</strong></h3><p>We paid for
      a small vehicle manual transmission - $ 245 for 4 days . In the end we
      were charged 305$. Why? Their reasoning, Parking Fees. It It was not okay
      but we did not have the strength to fight them. Instead we sent an email
      requesting cancellation of the &ldquo;Parking Fees&rdquo;. Their response
      was &ldquo;there is nothing to do, these are MESTRE procedures&rdquo;.
      Before closing on your rental, you may want to ask ,are there any
      &ldquo;parking fees?&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Pay attention to
      the car insurance you do -</strong></h3><p>It is important that you have
      insurance to cancel the deductible - either when you sign the rental forms
      or when you do travel insurance abroad, because it can sometimes cost a
      lot of money.</p><p>Pay attention to the exact times you take the vehicle
      and return it, because they can charge you extra
      money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Gas -</strong></h3><p>Make sure to
      demand to return the car with a <strong>full fuel tank</strong>, because
      the rental company will charge you a lot of money for the fuel if they
      fill it up.<strong> You better do
      it</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Photograph the car
      -</strong></h3><p>When you receive the car, photograph it, video tape it ,
      from all angles. Pay pay attention to</p><p>any scratches, dents or
      anything out of the ordinary. Immediately and tell the agent dealing with
      the vehicle. Taking both videos and photos is for your proof, otherwise
      the insurance company can blame you for things you did not do thereby
      charging you for damages.</p><p>Before driving off with your rental,
      inspect the trunk/boot for your emergency kit in case of a puncture - tire
      jack, tire iron that fits the lug nuts, spare tire with air in it, to
      replace a wheel</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, make sure that you know
      how to <strong>operate the vehicle so slide into the drivers seat and test
      all car controls . </strong>It sounds silly but you will thank me in your
      heart. Driving an unfamiliar car is already a distraction, therefore you
      should make sure you&rsquo;re all set and ready to focus on the road. Last
      but not least, know which fuel your car rental
      requires</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Drivers License
      -</strong></h3><p>Please note that you are to bring a valid driving
      license, or an international license. Please note that you
      <strong>must</strong> have the credit card with which you made the booking
      of the vehicle otherwise it can cause you problems.</p>

      <h2><strong>Review on Europcar -</strong></h2><p>Everything was fine with
      EUROPCAR. We paid an extra $ 60 for returning the car to the parking lot,
      at night (as we were told).</p><p>Written on the receipt that we received
      in in an email it turns out these are &ldquo;MESTRE'S FEES&rdquo;,
      something we were not told at the branch, not cool!</p><p>The explanation
      we received about returning the car was not great either, but that's how
      the Italians are. They do not like to elaborate and explain in
      depth.</p><p>Ask a lot of questions, make sure you know where to return
      the vehicle, and what happens if you are late</p>

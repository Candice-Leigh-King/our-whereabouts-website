  title: Canyonlands National Park mini guide
  description: >-
    If you're visiting Canyonlands National Park in Utah, here are some things
    you should know.

    I came with low expectations for Canyonlands and fell in love! It has to be
    one of the most underrated parks we've been to in Utah and I hope that you
    add it to your bucketlist. The Colorado River and Green River both go
    through Canyonlands and create the canyons the park takes its name from.

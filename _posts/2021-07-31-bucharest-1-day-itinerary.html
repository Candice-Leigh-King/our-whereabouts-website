      <h2><strong>Tour Inside Parliament Castle:</strong></h2><p>Start your
      morning with a tour in the heaviest building in the world. It is gorgeous
      inside!<br />Starting in 1984, The Palace has a height of 84 meters, a
      floor area of 365,000 square meters, and a volume of 2,550,000 cubic
      meters. The Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building in the
      world, weighing about 4,098,500,000 kilograms. The Palace of Parliament is
      the world&rsquo;s second-largest administrative building (after the
      Pentagon) and former dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu&rsquo;s most infamous
      creation. Entry is by guided tour only (book ahead) and you must bring
      identification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Coral
      Temple:</strong></h2><p>This temple is a copy of Vienna's
      Leopoldstadt-Tempelgasse Great Synagogue, which was raised in 1855-1858.
      It was designed by Enderle and Freiwald and built between 1864 - 1866. The
      far-right Legionaries devastated the synagogue but were restored after
      World War II in 1945. The main hall was recently refurbished and re-opened
      in 2015. We enjoyed our tour with Naomi there.<br /><strong>Opening

      Carol I himself laid the cornerstone of the new building. The architect

      architects active in the Kingdom of Romania in the late 19th century -he

      completed in 1888. Built in the neoclassical style, it features a porch of

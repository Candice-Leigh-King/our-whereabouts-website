      <h2><strong>Tour Inside Parliament Castle:</strong></h2><p>Start your
      morning with a tour in the heaviest building in the world. It is gorgeous
      inside!<br />Starting in 1984, The Palace has a height of 84 meters, a
      floor area of 365,000 square meters, and a volume of 2,550,000 cubic
      meters. The Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building in the
      world, weighing about 4,098,500,000 kilograms. The Palace of Parliament is
      the world&rsquo;s second-largest administrative building (after the
      Pentagon) and former dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu&rsquo;s most infamous
      creation. Entry is by guided tour only (book ahead) and you must bring
      identification.</p><h2><strong>Coral Temple:</strong></h2><p>This temple
      is a copy of Vienna's Leopoldstadt-Tempelgasse Great Synagogue, which was
      raised in 1855-1858. It was designed by Enderle and Freiwald and built
      between 1864 - 1866. The far-right Legionaries devastated the synagogue
      but were restored after World War II in 1945. The main hall was recently
      refurbished and re-opened in 2015. We enjoyed our tour with Naomi
      there.<br /><strong>Opening Hours:</strong> Monday - Thursday 9:00 -
      15:00. On Sat &amp; Sun it is closed.<br /><strong>Price:</strong> 15 Lei
      (3.20 USD).</p><h2><strong>Carturesti Carusel:</strong></h2><p>Carturesti
      Carusel is a bookstore on <strong>Lipscani 55 Street</strong> in the old
      town of Bucharest. It belongs to the Romanian bookstore chain Cărtureşti,
      and it's one of the most fantastic books stores. It's got booked, games,
      and even a gorgeous cafe.</p><h3><strong>Stroll around the Center of
      Town:</strong></h3><p>Just absorb this beautiful city there is great
      architecture on every corner.​​​​​​</p><p>Make sure not to miss
      these:</p><p>&bull;<strong>Savings Bank&rsquo;s Palace:</strong> This
      building doesn't look like a savings bank but it was initially CEC Savings
      Bank headquarters built in 1900. CEC is the oldest Romanian bank. The
      construction of a home worthy of its importance started in 1897, and King
      Carol I himself laid the cornerstone of the new building. The architect
      who designed the majestic palace, Paul Gottereau, is one of the French
      architects active in the Kingdom of Romania in the late 19th century -he
      also designed the Carol I Royal Foundation&rsquo;s building, and today it
      is still CEC bank headquarters. However, the building has been sold to the
      municipality of Bucharest for an eventual
      museum.</p><p>&bull;<strong>Stavropoleus monastery</strong>: Probably the
      most visited in Bucharest, the lovely Stavropoleos Monastery Church is a
      must if you&rsquo;d like to explore one of the most remarkable religious
      monuments in the capital. Monastery has a rich collection of rare icons,
      iconoclastic objects, and old history and religious books. To visit the
      monastery's museum, <em><strong>you must reserve a spot in
      advance.</strong></em></p><h2><strong>Cismigiu
      Gardens:</strong></h2><p>Located in the center of Bucharest is Cismigiu
      Gardens. It is Bucharest's first public garden, opened back in 1854, and
      it is a great location to relax after all that walking and have a picnic.
      The park's design was inspired by English gardens, and it features
      playgrounds, green meadows, and gazebos that host live concerts in the
      summer. There is a lake in the middle of the parks that you can skate on
      during the winter.</p>

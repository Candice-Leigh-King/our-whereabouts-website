  title: Cadini di Misurina hike
  description: >-
    Most people visit the Dolomites hike Tre Cime, but there's an unpopular hike
    you must add to your itinerary called Cadini di Misurina. Cadini di Misurina
    has beautiful views throughout the hike. At the end you arrive at a very
    narrow viewpoint where you can get up close with these magnificent peaks
    that remind the mountains of Mordor in Lord of the Rings.

      <h2><strong>How to get there:</strong></h2><p>The starting point of the
      Cadini di Misurina hike is called <strong>Rifugio Auronzo</strong>, just
      like the Tre Cime di Lavaredo hike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Entrance
      fee:</strong></h2><p>Since it is a national park, you'll need to pay 30
      Euro per car, at the entrance. <strong>Remember:</strong> Bring cash
      because they do not accept credit
      cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Opening hours:</strong></h2><p>The park
      is open between 7 AM - 7 PM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Starting</strong>
      <strong>&amp; End point:</strong></h2><p>Rifugio Auronzo. If you see
      everyone walking to the left you're going to want to walk in the
      <strong>opposite directions</strong> since Cadini di Misurina is less
      known and most are walking towards Tre Cime. The pathway starts from the
      parking lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Bathrooms:</strong></h2><p>The
      little hut at Rifugio Auronzo has bathrooms that cost 1 Euro. A little
      warning, the bathrooms are literally a hole in the ground (just like the
      bathrooms in
      Asia)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Distance:</strong></h2><p>The hike is
      about 4km.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Duration:</strong></h2><p>It takes
      about 1.5 - 2 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Elevation
      gain:</strong></h2><p>The total incline is around 112
      meters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Difficulty:</strong></h2><p>Some will
      say easy and some will say moderate. <strong>I would say it is moderate
      due to the slippery gravel road at times.</strong> People will warn you
      that this hike is not recommended for those who have a fear of heights, it
      is VERY VERY TURE!</p>

      <h2><strong>Our experience:</strong></h2><p>Before I tell you what we
      experienced during this hike, let me give you a little back story. Dan was
      recovering from his surgeries &amp; we were both just getting back in
      shape. We were still in the <strong>beginner's phase of hiking.
      </strong>Also, I want to note that <strong>both of us DO NOT have a fear
      of heights!</strong></p><p>We started the hike whilst enjoying the views
      of the mountains all around. Eventually, you'll reach a part where the
      path splits. Since it's a loop hike you're supposed to go on the left
      path, returning from the right path. We went to the left until we got to
      this beautiful spot in the photo. At this spot, we relaxed &amp; enjoyed
      the view. Gotta take in all the smells!! When we got up to continue the
      hike we noticed that the path ahead looked a little unsafe. There is a
      sheer drop with nowhere to hold unto (This is where hiking gear could
      really help). We started walking but something I never felt before, took
      hold of me, <strong>FEAR</strong>. I felt unsafe and alerted Dan to stop
      moving forwards.</p><p>Usually, you'll see me sitting on the edge of a
      cliff &amp; hear Dan yell at me that it's dangerous but this time Dan was
      a little more fearless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Our
      tips:</strong></h2><ul><li>Instead of following the official trail along
      the ridgeline, take the path on your right side that goes a little bit
      down &amp; loops around the mountain. It&rsquo;s a small rocky trail &amp;
      like the other path it can only fit one person.</li><li>Dress attire - In
      the world of hiking boots there is a huge variety. When traveling light,
      wearing light hiking boots and layers can be extremely helpful</li></ul>

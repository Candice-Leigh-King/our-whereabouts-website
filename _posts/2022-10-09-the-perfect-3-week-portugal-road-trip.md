      Palace:&nbsp;</strong>We didn't plan on visiting Sintra National Palace,
      we wanted to visit Monserrate Palace. Still, we accidentally purchased
      tickets to Sintra National Palace, so after grabbing lunch in the center
      of town, we decided to hop on in to take a glance at the interior of the
      palace.<br /><strong>&bull;Quinta da Regaleira:&nbsp;</strong>This Gothic
      palace is a must-visit landmark visiting Sintra and has to be our favorite
      palace. The opulent palace has spectacular gardens with a surrealistic
      initiation well and ornate follies.</p>

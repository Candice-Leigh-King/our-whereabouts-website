      <p><strong>2. MEANING OF METEORA</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The name was derived
      from a Greek contraction meaning &ldquo;suspended in the air.&rdquo;
      Meteora gets its name from the monasteries that sit high atop the stone
      pillars.</p>

      <p><strong>3. HISTORY</strong></p><p>Hermit monks first climbed these
      soaring rocks to settle in the caves and hollows of the rocks as early as
      the 9th century. During the time of the Turkish occupation, the Hermit
      monks climbed higher and higher up the rock face until they were living on
      the peaks where they were able to build by bringing materiel and people up
      by ladders and baskets.</p><p>The first monastery that was built on a
      summit dates to the 14th century, when Athanasios Koinovitis, a monk from
      Mount Athos, ascended and built the first structure, the Great
      Meteoron.</p><p><strong>4. HOW IT WAS FORMED</strong></p><p>About 60
      million years ago, a series of earth movements pushed the seabed upwards,
      creating a high plateau and causing many vertical fault lines in the thick
      layer of sandstone.</p><p>The rocks are made from sandstone and
      conglomerate rocks.</p>

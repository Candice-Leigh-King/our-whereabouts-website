  description: >-
    Hermit monks first climbed these soaring rocks to settle in the caves and
    hollows of the rocks as early as the 9th century. During the time of the
    Turkish occupation, the Hermit monks climbed higher and higher up the rock
    face until they were living on the peaks where they were able to build by
    bringing materiel and people up by ladders and baskets.

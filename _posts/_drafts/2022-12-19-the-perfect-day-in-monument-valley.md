  title: The Perfect Day in Monument Valley
  description: >-
    Most people drive through Monument Valley and skip straight to the Forrest
    Gump stop, but the Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park has a beautiful
    17-mile loop road & it's worth visiting.

    You can self-drive this loop it’s a little bumpy & dusty, but we did it with
    our rental car with no problems.

    If it rains, this road can become impassable so check the weather before
    your visit.

      <h1>17-mile scenic drive:</h1><p>&bull;The wildcat Trail: This hike is a
      3.2-mile loop that circles around the Mitten Buttes and Merrick Butte
      &amp; offer incredible views.</p><p>&bull;The Mittens &amp; Merrick Butte:
      This stop is a great spot to get up close to these
      monuments.</p><p>&bull;The Three Sisters: Opposite the Mittens,
      you&rsquo;ll find the Three Sisters. These three finger-like stones rise
      out of the red rock.</p><p>&bull;John Ford&rsquo;s point: This is our
      favorite and most iconic spot on the loop. Named after film director John
      Ford, who filmed Stagecoach. For 5$ you can even take an iconic shot on a
      horse.</p><p>&bull;Totem pole: It is an incredible and remarkable rock
      feature. It is the tallest spire in the world at a prominence of 381
      feet.</p><p>&bull;Artist&rsquo;s point: Another popular scenic point.</p>

    heading: Forrest Gump Point
    textarea: >-
      This is the most famous spot. It's best to visit this spot in the morning
      or early afternoon because, in the late afternoon and early evening,
      you'll be facing the sun. The speed limit on this road is 65 mph, so it's
      important to watch out for cars because this road gets busy, especially in
      the afternoon.

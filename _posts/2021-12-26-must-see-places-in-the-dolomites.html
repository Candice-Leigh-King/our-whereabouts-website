      <p>Alpe di Siusi is one of the popular locations in the Dolomites and for
      a good reason. It is a high alpine meadow, the largest high altitude
      alpine meadow in Europe and it is a really magical place to explore.</p>

      <h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to
      get there:</strong> You can either drive up or take the cable car.
      <strong>Car:</strong> If you're looking to drive up, do know that the
      roads are closed between 9am to 5pm, you can drive up to
      <strong><em>Compatsch</em></strong> before 9am or after 5pm. From there
      you'll need to walk about an hour to reach the most picturesque part of
      Alpe di Siusi (shown in photo). <strong>Parking:</strong> Parking
      is<strong> </strong>19 Euro (you can only pay for a full day)
      <strong>Cable car:</strong> If you're looking to take the cable car you
      can take it from Ortisei, Val Gardena. *Price: 19.90 Euro round
      trip.</p><p>*Hours: May to November from 8AM to 6PM. <strong>When to
      visit:</strong> Best to visit early in the morning and catch the sunrise
      or later to watch the sunset.</p><p><strong>Hiking trails:</strong> There
      are so many hiking trails here and it is very easy to spend a whole day
      here. Once you get off the cable car you'll have many options for
      different trails. Most the trails are flat and easy. We chose a circular
      trail around the Alpe di Siusi area which was <strong>5.3km long</strong>.
      We followed trail number 9 until the Schgaguler hut and Hotel Sole and
      followed trail number 6B until Sanon hut. From there follow the trail
      number 6A and 6B up to the Cotrin hut to return to the starting point and
      take the cable car down to Ortisei.</p>

      <p>Val di Funes, aka Villn&ouml;ss, is a must while visiting the
      Dolomites. This valley is beautiful and peaceful with the iconic views of
      the Geisler/Odle peaks. For Val di Funes travel guide</p>

      <h3><strong>Things to do in Val di
      Funes:</strong></h3><p><strong>Hiking:</strong><strong> </strong>If you
      love to hike, there are a few great trails in Val di Funes. The most
      popular ones are: The Adolf Munkel Trail and the Alpe di Funes,
      Herrensteigrunde which is a circular hike and Ridge Trail. Sadly, we
      didn't have the time to do any of these hikes.</p><p><strong>Santa
      Maddalena:</strong><strong> </strong>A small village in the Funes Valley
      that's located 15 minutes away from San Giovanni church. It&rsquo;s a
      great place to start the excellent Panoramaweg and Sunnseitenweg trails
      that offer a gorgeous views of the Santa Maddelena
      Church.</p><p><strong>Santa Maddalena Viewpoint:</strong><strong>
      </strong>This is the most Instagrammable spot with the view of Santa
      Maddalena church and the famous Odle mountains in the background. Please
      respect the signs and do not walk on the grass there! We saw many
      photographers doing so all for the sake of a
      photo.</p><p><strong>Chiesetta di San Giovanni Church in
      Ranui:</strong><strong> </strong>Also known as Church of St. Johann, this
      place is Instagram famous for a good reason. It's a beautiful church
      surrounded by by green meadows, lush trees and Odle peaks behind it. Since
      this place blew up on social media people were trampling the meadow in
      front of the church, a field that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s private
      property. Therefore the owners enclosed the surrounding meadows and church
      by a large fence.</p>

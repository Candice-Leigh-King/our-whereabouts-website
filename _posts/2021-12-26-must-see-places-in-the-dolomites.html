      <p><strong>3. HISTORY</strong></p><p>Hermit monks first climbed these
      soaring rocks to settle in the caves and hollows of the rocks as early as
      the 9th century. During the time of the Turkish occupation, the Hermit
      monks climbed higher and higher up the rock face until they were living on
      the peaks where they were able to build by bringing materiel and people up
      by ladders and baskets.</p><p>The first monastery that was built on a
      summit dates to the 14th century, when Athanasios Koinovitis, a monk from
      Mount Athos, ascended and built the first structure, the Great
      Meteoron.</p>

      <p><strong>4. HOW IT WAS FORMED</strong></p><p>About 60 million years ago,
      a series of earth movements pushed the seabed upwards, creating a high
      plateau and causing many vertical fault lines in the thick layer of
      sandstone.</p><p>The rocks are made from sandstone and conglomerate
      rocks.</p>

      <p>Alpe di Siusi is one of the popular locations in the Dolomites and for
      a good reason. It is a high alpine meadow, the largest high altitude
      alpine meadow in Europe and it is a really magical place to explore.</p>

      <h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to
      get there:</strong> You can either drive up or take the cable car.
      <strong>Car:</strong> If you're looking to drive up, do know that the
      roads are closed between 9am to 5pm, you can drive up to
      <strong><em>Compatsch</em></strong> before 9am or after 5pm. From there
      you'll need to walk about an hour to reach the most picturesque part of
      Alpe di Siusi (shown in photo). <strong>Parking:</strong> Parking
      is<strong> </strong>19 Euro (you can only pay for a full day)
      <strong>Cable car:</strong> If you're looking to take the cable car you
      can take it from Ortisei, Val Gardena. *Price: 19.90 Euro round
      trip.</p><p>*Hours: May to November from 8AM to 6PM. <strong>When to
      visit:</strong> Best to visit early in the morning and catch the sunrise
      or later to watch the sunset.</p><p><strong>Hiking trails:</strong> There
      are so many hiking trails here and it is very easy to spend a whole day
      here. Once you get off the cable car you'll have many options for
      different trails. Most the trails are flat and easy. We chose a circular
      trail around the Alpe di Siusi area which was <strong>5.3km long</strong>.
      We followed trail number 9 until the Schgaguler hut and Hotel Sole and
      followed trail number 6B until Sanon hut. From there follow the trail
      number 6A and 6B up to the Cotrin hut to return to the starting point and
      take the cable car down to Ortisei.</p>

        clicks on a link in the navigation, then you'll need to add a page id.
        The page id can be added in the below box labeled "link". Your id is a
        short word describing the section it is leading to. For example- about.
        If you don't want this section to link from the navigation, you can
        simply leave it out.

  description: >
    As you scroll through social media and you see all these beautiful shots
    people take with these unique and stunning bridges one might think that they
    are all noticeable and easy to find. Well that is not the case. Did you know
    that there are 400 bridges in Venice? Yes, that is a large amount of
    bridges. I'm here to help you out with find these beautiful bridges.

    I added a map that I created here of the distracts in Venice so it could
    help you.

      <h2><strong>CALLE DRIO CHIESA BRIDGE</strong></h2><p><strong>District: San
      Marco.<br />Location: Near Teatro La Fenice.</strong></p><p>Enter 'Hotel
      San Moise' into your google maps. Once you see the hotel on your right
      you'll find a small dock on your left where this photo was taken. Not many
      people know about this spot and the location of it makes it invisible to
      those who aren't aware of this
      spot.</p><h4><strong>Coordinates:</strong></h4><p>45.433443, 12.335059</p>

      <h2><strong>PONTE MARIA CALLAS BRIDGE</strong></h2><p><strong>District:
      San Marco.<br />Location: Near Teatro La Fenice</strong></p><p>This
      beautiful bridge on a very small canal is hidden between the buildings,
      which creates a very cozy and picturesque spot. What adds even more charm
      to it is the Santo Stefano bell tower behind.</p>

        If you would like that awesome scroll feature that happens when someone
        clicks on a link in the navigation, then you'll need to add a page id.
        The page id can be added in the below box labeled "link". Your id is a
        short word describing the section it is leading to. For example- about.
        If you don't want this section to link from the navigation, you can
        simply leave it out.

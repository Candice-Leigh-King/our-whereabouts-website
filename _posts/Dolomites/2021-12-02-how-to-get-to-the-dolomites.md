      <h2><strong>Plane:</strong></h2><p>There are no international airports in
      the Dolomites therefore if you're coming from out of the country
      <strong>the best airport</strong> to land in is <strong>Venice Marco Polo
      Airport.</strong> It is the closest, about 160km
      away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other options include:</p><ul><li>Bologna
      Airport is about 300km away.</li><li>Milan Airport is 318km
      away.</li><li>Munich, Germany Airport is about 368km
      away.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Car:</strong></h2><p>The best way
      of getting around in the Dolomites is by car! Getting around by public
      transportation isn't easy in the Dolomites and if you truly want to
      experience this area to its fullest you need to rent a
      car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Renting a
      car:</strong></h3><p><strong>Where?</strong> Mestre, Venice (It isn't
      really Venice, but it's a short bus ride away from Venice).<br
      /><strong>Company:</strong> We rented the car through Europcar.<br
      /><strong>Cost:</strong> Since we booked our trip last minute it was a bit
      pricey for an automatic car, so we rented a manual car for 278 Euro for 4
      days.<br />*Manual cars are pretty common in Italy and also much cheaper!
      We saved an extra 223 euros by renting a manual car over an automatic
      one.</p><p><strong>Gas Cost:</strong> We spent 194.84 euros and drove
      about 771km in total.</p><p><a
      href="https://travel.usnews.com/Monterey_CA/">︎</a> <strong>Should you
      rent a car?&nbsp;</strong>Our recommendation is YES! The Dolomites is a
      <strong>HUGE</strong> area! Getting from one area to another takes a
      while.<br />You could rely on public transportation but it shouldn't be
      the first option. There are buses around the Dolomites that can take you
      to popular destinations like Lago di Baries, Lago di Carezza and Ortisei,
      but do remember arrival time will be based on the availability and timing
      of the public transportation.</p><p><strong>Do you have to rent a
      car?&nbsp;</strong>No. Saying that, a car offers more flexibility and is a
      time saver.</p>

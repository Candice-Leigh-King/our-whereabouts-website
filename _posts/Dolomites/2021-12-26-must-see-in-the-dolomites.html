      <h2>Alpe di Siusi</h2><p>Alpe di Siusi is one of the popular locations in
      the Dolomites and for a good reason. It is a high alpine meadow, the
      largest high-altitude alpine meadow in Europe and it is a really magical
      place to explore.</p>

      <h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to
      get there:</strong> You can either drive up or take the cable car.
      <strong>Car:</strong> If you're looking to drive up, do know that the
      roads are closed between 9 am to 5 pm, you can drive up to
      <strong><em>Compatsch</em></strong> before 9 am or after 5 pm. From there
      you'll need to walk for about an hour to reach the most picturesque part
      of Alpe di Siusi (shown in the photo).<br /><strong>Parking:</strong>
      Parking is<strong> </strong>19 Euro (you can only pay for a full day).<br
      /><strong>Cable car:</strong> If you're looking to take the cable car you
      can take it from Ortisei, Val Gardena.<br />*Price: 19.90 Euro round
      trip.<br />*Hours: May to November from 8 am to 6 pm.<br /><strong>When to
      visit:</strong> Best to visit early in the morning and catch the sunrise
      or later to watch the sunset.</p><p><strong>Hiking trails:</strong>
      &nbsp;There are so many hiking trails here and it is very easy to spend a
      whole day here. Once you get off the cable car you'll have many options
      for different trails. Most of the trails are flat and easy. We chose a
      circular trail around the Alpe di Siusi area which was <strong>5.3km
      long</strong>. We followed trail number 9 until the Schgaguler hut and
      Hotel Sole and followed trail number 6B until Sanon hut. From there follow
      trail numbers 6A and 6B up to the Cotrin hut to return to the starting
      point and take the cable car down to Ortisei.</p>

      <h2>Val di Funes</h2><p>Val di Funes, aka Villn&ouml;ss, is a must while
      visiting the Dolomites. This valley is beautiful and peaceful with iconic
      views of the Geisler/Odle peaks. For Val di Funes travel guide</p>
    quote_html:

      <h3><strong>Things to do in Val di Funes:</strong></h3><p><strong>Hiking:
      </strong>If you love to hike, there are a few great trails in Val di
      Funes. The most popular ones are The Adolf Munkel Trail and the Alpe di
      Funes, Herrensteigrunde which is a circular hike, and Ridge Trail. Sadly,
      we didn't have the time to do any of these hikes.</p><p><strong>Santa
      Maddalena: </strong>A small village in the Funes Valley that's located 15
      minutes away from San Giovanni church. It&rsquo;s a great place to start
      the excellent Panoramaweg and Sunnseitenweg trails that offer gorgeous
      views of the Santa Maddelena Church.</p><p><strong>Santa Maddalena
      Viewpoint: </strong>This is the most Instagrammable spot with the view of
      Santa Maddalena church and the famous Odle mountains in the background.
      Please respect the signs and do not walk on the grass there! We saw many
      photographers doing so all for the sake of a
      photo.</p><p><strong>Chiesetta di San Giovanni Church in Ranui:
      </strong>Also known as Church of St. Johann, this place is
      Instagram-famous for a good reason. It's a beautiful church surrounded by
      green meadows, lush trees, and Odle peaks behind it. Since this place blew
      up on social media people were trampling the meadow in front of the
      church, a field that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s private property. Therefore
      the owners enclosed the surrounding meadows and church with a large
      fence.</p>

      <h2>Lago di Braies</h2><p>No trip to the Dolomites is complete without a
      stop at Lago di Braies, (aka Pragser Wildsee, in German). This lake has
      become one of the most Instgrammble spots in the Dolomites and for a good
      reason. The blue/emerald green color of its clear waters and natural
      scenery is mesmerizing.</p>

      Braies:</strong></h3><p><strong>Walking around: </strong>There is a loop
      hike around the lake is 3.5km and takes about 1.5 hours, definitely worth
      doing so you can be able to appreciate the different points of view on the
      lake.</p><p><strong>The Lakeside Chapel:</strong> Don't miss this cute
      chapel on the west side of the lake. It was built in 1904 and was used
      during World War II by a German SS commander who chose it as a meeting
      place for a prisoner exchange.</p><p><strong>Rent a boat: </strong>One of
      the popular activities here is renting a boat.</p><p><strong>Boat Rental

      <h2>Lago di Carezza</h2><p>Our first stop in the Dolomites was Lago di
      Carezza. Lago di Carezza, aka, Karersee in German, is a small alpine lake
      and is known for its wonderful colors and view of mount Latemar. It is one
      of the most beautiful lakes in the Dolomites and should be on your
      itinerary when visiting.</p>
    quote_html:
    2-textarea_html: >-
      <h3><strong>Things to do in Lago di
      Carezza:</strong></h3><p><strong>Entrance Fee:</strong><strong>
      </strong>Free.</p><p><strong>When to visit:</strong><strong>
      </strong>Sunrise and sunset are both magical times to visit Lago di
      Carezza. We tried for sunset..... But the weather was
      horrible.</p><p><strong>Parking:</strong><strong> </strong>The parking lot
      is pretty cheap and brings you straight to the beautiful small lake. The
      first 15 minutes are free, One hour costs 1 Euro, 2 hours costs 2 Euro,
      And 2-6 hours cost 4 Euro.</p><p><strong>How to get there:
      </strong>There's a small walking circular trail around the lake that takes
      about 20 minutes. It's a beautiful walk through the Latemar forest that
      surrounds the lake. It&rsquo;s an easy walk with a few great lookout
      points to view from different angles.</p><p><strong>Walking
      around:</strong><strong> </strong>There's a small walking circular trail

      the Latermar forest that surrounds the lake. It&rsquo;s a easy walk with a
      few great lookout points to view from different
      angles.</p><p><strong>Swimming: </strong>Swimming here is not allowed
      since the lake is a protected natural landmark and is fenced all around.
      Climbing the fence is prohibited. Why am I mentioning this? Many people
      climb the fence, and take their awesome Instagram shots with the big rock
      without realizing this is prohibited and violators will be
      FINED!</p><p><strong>Drones:</strong><strong> </strong>It is prohibited to
      fly drones here.</p><p><strong>Food:</strong><strong>
      </strong>There&rsquo;s a restaurant and a caf&eacute; serving food,
      drinks, and souvenirs. The food and drinks were reasonably
      priced.</p><p><strong>Bathrooms:</strong><strong> </strong>Public
      bathrooms are available in the tunnel linking the parking lot to the
      lake</p>

      <h2>Seceda</h2><p>We almost skipped Seceda due to the weather predictions
      but when we woke up and saw that we were blessed with a beautiful day, we
      decided to go up. It quickly became one of our favorite spots in the
      Dolomites because it has a panorama that definitely stands out and is so
      very unique. There are two ways to get up to Seceda, you could either hike
      up or take the cable car. I'm going to focus on the first option.</p>
    quote_html:
    2-textarea_html: >-
      <h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to
      get there:</strong><strong> </strong>The cable car to Seceda is called
      'Seceda Valley Station' and is located in Ortisei, Val
      Gardena</p><p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>Parking costs 1.5 Euros per
      hour or 8 euros for the day.<br /><br /><strong>When to
      visit:</strong><strong> </strong>Best months From June to September
      (depending on the year, there may still be snow in May). To avoid crowds
      aim for September-October.<br />During the winter Seceda is used as a ski
      slope.<br /><br /><strong>Cable car: </strong>This is the best and easiest
      way to reach the top. From Ortisei, the cable car goes to Furnes and from
      there you have to change and take the Gondola to Seceda. You can purchase
      the ticket from the counter or online. Opening times may vary due to
      weather conditions, so you should check the cable car schedules before you
      go.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> 35 Euro per person return ticket, from
      Ortisei to Seceda and back (it includes both cable cars). If you'd like to
      take the Cable car up and hike down, a one-way ticket will cost you 25
      Euro</p><p><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Winter Season (December to
      mid-April): From 8:30 and 16:30<strong> </strong>Summer Season (end of May
      to mid-October): From 8:30 to 17:30.</p>

      <h2>Cadini di Misurina</h2><p>Most people who visit the Dolomites hike Tre
      Cime, but there's an unpopular hike you must add to your itinerary called
      <strong>Cadini di Misurina.</strong> Cadini di Misurina has beautiful
      views throughout the hike. At the end, you arrive at a very narrow
      viewpoint where you can get up close with these magnificent peaks that
      remind the mountains of Mordor in Lord of the Rings.</p>
    quote_html:
    2-textarea_html: >-
      <h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to
      get there:</strong><strong> </strong>The starting point of the Cadini di
      Misurina hike is called <strong><em>Rifugio Auronzo</em></strong>, just
      like the Tre Cime di Lavaredo hike.</p><p><strong>Entrance fee:</strong>
      Since it is a national park, you'll need to pay 30 Euro per car, at the
      entrance.<em> </em><strong><em>Remember:</em></strong> Bring cash because
      they do not accept credit cards.</p><p><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong><strong> </strong>The park is open between 7 AM - 7
      PM.</p><p><strong>Starting</strong> <strong>&amp; End
      point:</strong><strong> </strong>Rifugio Auronzo. If you see everyone
      walking to the left you're going to want to walk in the
      <strong><em>opposite directions</em></strong> since Cadini di Misurina is
      less known and most are walking towards Tre Cime. The pathway starts from
      the parking lot.</p><p><strong>Bathrooms:</strong> The little hut at
      Rifugio Auronzo has bathrooms that cost 1 Euro. A little warning, the
      bathrooms are literally a hole in the ground (just like the bathrooms in
      Asia)</p><p><strong>Distance:</strong><strong> </strong>The hike is about
      4km.</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong><strong> </strong>It takes about 1.5
      - 2 hours.</p><p><strong>Elevation gain:</strong> The total incline is
      around 112 meters.</p><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Some will say easy
      and some will say moderate. <strong><em>I would say it is moderate due to
      the slippery gravel road at times.</em></strong> People will warn you that
      this hike is not recommended for those who have a fear of heights, it is
      VERY VERY TURE!</p>

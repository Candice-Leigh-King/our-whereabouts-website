    Our first stop in the Dolomites was Lago di Carezza. Lago di Carezza, aka,
    Karersee in German, is a small alpine lake and is known for its wonderful
    colors and view of mount Latermar. It is one of the most beautiful lakes in
    the Dolomites and should be on your itinerary when visiting.

      <h2><strong>Some History:</strong></h2><p>This lake is about 240 million
      years old, and the whole area was once under the sea.<br />​​​​​​The lake
      is known as Rainbow lake because of its beautiful colors and the legend
      behind the lake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The
      Legend:</strong></h2><p>Once upon a time, there was a mermaid living in
      the lake. The wizard Masar&eacute; was in love with her. In order to
      seduce her, he followed the advice of the witch Lanwerda to dress up as a
      jewel merchant and throw a rainbow between Mt Catinaccio and Mt Latemar.
      The wizard did this, but he forgot to dress up as a jewel merchant. The
      beautiful mermaid realized that he was a wizard and disappeared into the
      lake. The wizard then threw the rainbow and all the jewels into the lake.
      That&rsquo;s why the lake still features such beautiful
      colors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Entrance
      Fee:</h2><p>Free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>When to
      visit:</strong></h2><p>In our opinion, the best time to visit Lago di
      Carezza is in the shoulder season (April-May and September-October), when
      the weather is still warm enough, the water high enough, and isn't as
      touristy.Sunrise and sunset are both magical times to visit Lago di
      Carezza. We tried for sunset..... But the weather was
      horrible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Parking:</strong></h3><p>The parking
      lot is pretty cheap and brings you straight to the beautiful small
      lake.<br />The first 15 minutes are free, One hour costs 1 Euro, 2 hours
      costs 2 Euro, And 2-6 hours cost 4 Euro.</p>

      <h2><strong>How to get there:</strong></h2><p>Obviously, the easiest way
      is by car but you could also take a bus from Bolzano to Val di Fassa and
      stops right at Lago di Carezza parking lot. The bus goes every 20 minutes
      and costs 4.50 Euro for a single ride and takes about an hour to get to
      the lake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Walking
      around:</strong></h2><p>There's a small walking circular trail around the
      lake that takes about 20 minutes. It's a beautiful walk through the
      Latemar forest that surrounds the lake. It&rsquo;s a easy walk with a few
      great lookout points to view from different
      angles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Swimming:</strong></h2><p>Swimming
      here is not allowed since the lake is a protected natural landmark and is
      fenced all around and it is prohibited to climb the fence. Many people
      climb the fence and take the Instagram shot with the big rock that's
      sticking out in front of the lake and the mountain view, do know that it
      is not allowed, and <strong>you could get
      FINED!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Drones:</strong></h2><p>It is
      prohibited to fly drones
      here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Food:</strong></h2><p>There&rsquo;s a
      restaurant and a caf&eacute; serving food, drinks, and souvenirs. The food
      and drinks were reasonable
      pricing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Bathrooms:</strong></h3><p>Public
      bathrooms are available in the tunnel linking the parking lot to the
      lake.</p>

      <p>Our photos don't do justice to how beautiful this place really is. We
      had bad weather and since we came from Venice where it was hot, we weren't
      prepared for this weather but trust me when I tell you that this lake must
      be on your list!</p>

      <h2><strong>Dates:</strong></h2><p>We visited mid-September which is the
      best time to visit since the tourists have already left the area.</p><p>We
      spent 4 days in the Dolomites (3 nights) and I have to tell you that we
      did not feel like this was enough time. If we could have, we would have
      added at least one more day in the Dolomites.</p>

      <h2><strong>Day 1:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Venice ➞ Lago di Carezza
      ➞ Val di Gardena</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> We left Mestre
      at 11AM towards Val di Gardena. We saw that Lago di Carezza was sort-of on
      the way to the hotel and decided to make a stop
      there.</p><p><strong>Distance driven:</strong> We drove 247km which is a
      total of 4 hours on the road. Honestly, the drive to the Dolomites took us
      more then double the amount it's supposed to because we were amazed by
      it's beauty and kept stopping along the way to take photos. Lago di
      Carezza is a must-see lake in the Dolomites.</p>

      <h2><strong>Day 2:</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Alpe di Siusi ➞ Val di
      Funes ➞ Val di Gardena</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We woke up pretty late since we
      arrived at our hotel late and took the cable car from Ortisei up to Alpe
      di Siusi. It was so beautiful up there we spent a few good hours here. If
      possible it is recommended to watch the sunrise or sunset here. We decided
      to drive a little to Val di Funes to watch the sunset. It was really
      beautiful.</p><p><strong>Distance driven: </strong>We drove 9.1km from our
      hotel to Val di Funes. We took free transportation from our hotel to Alpe
      di Siusi so we didn't need to drive there.</p>

  description: >-
    We almost skipped Seceda due to bad weather predictions. When we woke up, we
    were blessed with a beautiful day. Change of plans, HERE WE COME SECEDA!
    YEAH! It quickly became one of our favorite spots in the Dolomites because
    it has a panoramic view that definitely stands out has a unique view.

    There are two ways to get up to Seceda, you could either hike up or take the
    cable car. I'm going to focus on the second option, cable car.

      <h2><strong>How to get there:</strong></h2><p>The cable car to Seceda is
      called 'Seceda Valley Station' and is located in <strong>Ortisei, Val
      Gardena</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Parking:</strong></h2><p>Parking
      costs 1.5 Euro per hour or 8 Euro for the day.</p><h2><strong>When to
      visit:</strong></h2><p>Best months From June to September (depending on
      the weather that year, there may still be snow in May and it might start
      snowing as early as September). To avoid crowds, aim for
      September-October.</p><p><strong>During the winter Seceda is used as a ski
      slope.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Cable
      car:</strong></h2><p><strong>This is the best and easiest way to reach the
      top.</strong> You can purchase tickets from the ticket center or online.
      Opening times may vary due to weather conditions. Diligence requires you
      to check the cable car schedules before you go. From Ortisei, the cable
      car goes to Furnes and from there you have to change and take the Gondola
      to Seceda.</p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> 35 Euro per person return
      ticket, from Ortisei to Seceda and back (it includes both cable cars). If
      you'd like to take the Cable car up and <strong>hike down, a one-way
      ticket</strong> will cost you 25 Euro</li><li><strong>Opening hours:
      </strong>Winter Season (December to mid-April): 8:30-16:30. Summer Season
      (end of May to mid-October): from
      8:30-17:30</li></ul><h2><strong>Trails:</strong></h2><p>We walked around
      while enjoying the view. The path is a circular trail that takes about 30
      minutes <strong>if</strong> you don't stop to admire and take lots of
      beautiful photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Seceda Lookout point:</strong> Once
      you arrive at the cable car station, you can reach the panoramic viewpoint
      in just 10 minutes. There is a metal ring with the names of all the
      mountains on it, so you know what mountains you're
      seeing.</li><li><strong>Pieralongia:</strong> We didn't do this hike,
      since it's about 2-3 hours and we were short with time, but I was told
      it's an easy 5km hike. It starts at the cable car station.</li></ul>

      <h2><strong>Food:</strong></h2><p>There are two restaurants on the slope
      called<strong> </strong>Baita Sofie H&uuml;tte and Baita Daniel
      H&uuml;tte. Baita Sofie H&uuml;tte is located not far from the Cable car
      station but Baita Daniel H&uuml;tte is 1.7km down hill. You can always sit
      down, relax and have a picnic. Please leave no
      trace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Bathrooms:</strong></h2><p>There are
      bathrooms right as you get off the cable car and it's
      <strong>free!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Attire
      Essentials:</strong></h2><p>In the mountains, the weather can be
      unpredictable. Always pack layers and warm clothes, suitable hiking shoes,
      and a raincoat.</p>

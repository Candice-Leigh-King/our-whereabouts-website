  description: >-
    Hermit monks first climbed these soaring rocks to settle in the caves and
    hollows of the rocks as early as the 9th century. During the time of the
    Turkish occupation, the Hermit monks climbed higher and higher up the rock
    face until they were living on the peaks where they were able to build by
    bringing materiel and people up by ladders and baskets.

      <p>Val di Funes, aka Villn&ouml;ss, is a must while visiting the
      Dolomites. This valley is beautiful and peaceful with iconic views of the
      Geisler/Odle peaks</p>

      <h2><strong>When to visit:</strong></h2><p>The best time is in the
      shoulder season (April-May and September-October), when the weather is
      still warm enough and isn't as touristy.</p><h2><strong>Best time of day
      to visit:</strong></h2><p>Arrive for sunrise or sunset. We had the most
      magical sunset here.</p><h2><strong>How to get there:</strong></h2><p>The
      easiest way to get there is by car but you could also take a bus from
      Bolzano and Ortisei.</p><ul><li>From Bolzano it'll take about an hour and
      a half and it'll cost about 6 Euro.</li><li>From Ortisei you'll need to
      take 2 buses. The first bus from Ortisei to Brixen, and switch buses
      towards Klamm. It'll take about an hour and a half and cost about 7.5
      Euro.</li></ul><h2>​​​​<strong>Parking:</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Parking
      shouldn't be an issue, there are many places to park.</p></li><li>The best
      place to park is in a place called Ranui, which costs 4 euros for one day
      or 2 euros for those staying in the valley.</li><li>Another option is
      Ranui Turning Point, Car Park. It costs 2 Euro for 2 hours on the
      weekdays, on Sundays and Holidays it costs 4
      Euro.</li></ul><h2><strong>Where to eat:</strong></h2><p>There isn't much
      in Val di Funes besides nature so bring food. If you're looking for a
      recommendation on where to eat, we ate dinner at Hotel Fines restaurant
      and really enjoyed it.</p><h2><strong>Drones:</strong></h2><p>Flying
      drones is not allowed, but of course people do it anyway, I hope you
      respect the nature and the rules of the place.</p>

      <h2><strong>Things to do in Val di
      Funes:</strong></h2><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Hikes:</strong></h3><p>If
      you love to hike, there are a few great trails in Val di Funes. The most
      popular ones are the Adolf Munkel Trail and the Alpe di Funes,
      Herrensteigrunde which is a circular hike, and Ridge Trail. Sadly, we
      didn't have the time to do any of these hikes.</p>

      <h3><strong>Santa Maddalena:</strong></h3><p>A small village in the Funes
      Valley that's located 15 minutes away from San Giovanni church. It&rsquo;s
      a great place to start the excellent Panoramaweg and Sunnseitenweg trails
      that offer gorgeous views of the Santa Maddelena Church.</p>

      <h3><strong>Chiesetta di San Giovanni Church in
      Ranui:</strong></h3><p>Also known as the Church of St. Johann, this place
      is Instagram-famous for a good reason. It's a beautiful church surrounded
      by green meadows, lush trees, and Odle peaks behind it. Since this place
      blew up on social media people were trampling the meadow in front of the
      church,<strong> a field that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s private property.
      </strong>Therefore the owners enclosed the surrounding meadows and church
      with a large fence</p>

      <h4><strong>Here are 3 ways to see the
      church:</strong></h4><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>If you'd like to enter
      the church or get close you'll need to head to the road to the Ranuihof
      Farm. There you'll find a gated entry point, where you have to purchase a
      ticket in order to enter. It costs 4 Euro per person. Bring small cash
      because the machine only accepts small cash and won't return the change. I
      recommend paying 4 euros as the chapel is very impressive and there is a
      series of paintings that tell the story of St. John.</p><ul><li>Parking:
      St. Johann, 39040 Villn&ouml;&szlig;, Autonome Provinz Bozen -
      S&uuml;dtirol.</li></ul><p><strong>We saw people climbing over the fence
      without shame. Please respect this place, the people, and
      nature.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. </strong>There is a viewing
      platform along St. Johann/San Giovanni road, free of charge where you can
      take a photo. If you're looking on google maps it's called Bester Blick
      auf die Kirche.</p><ul><li>Parking: Ranui, 39040 St.
      Maddalena.</li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> If you follow the Panorama road
      from Santa Maddalena you&rsquo;ll also encounter a stunning viewpoint over
      the San Giovanni church!</p>

      <h2><strong>Piazza San Marco:</strong></h2><p>St. Mark's square is one of
      the most popular spots in the city. It is the city's main public square
      and contains its most famous buildings such as St Mark's Basilica and the
      Doge's Palace. Napoleon called it &ldquo;the world's most beautiful
      drawing room&rdquo;. Make sure to arrive early in the morning so you could
      catch the magical sunrise there and get to really explore its beauty while
      the rest of the city sleeps.</p><h2><strong>T Fondaco Rooftop
      Terrance:</strong></h2><p>Next to Rialto bridge, there is a cool shopping
      mall, inside this mall, there is a secret viewpoint called T Fondaco
      Rooftop Terrance. There is no entrance fee but you must reserve your
      15-minute time slot online in advance!</p><p><strong>Opening
      hours:</strong> Daily, 10:30 AM to 6:30
      PM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Libreria Aqua Alta:</strong></h2><p>The
      most unique bookstore you'll ever visit. The magic starts the moment you
      enter. You'll find hidden gems all around, friendly cats everywhere, a
      gondola in the middle of the store and at the end of it is a photo
      op.</p><p><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Daily, 9 AM to 7:45 PM.</p><p>We
      were very tired since we woke up very early so we decided to end the day
      pretty early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Arsenale Di
      Venezia:</strong></h2><p>It is a beautiful complex of former shipyards and
      armories clustered together in the city of Venice. Not many people go here
      and it's a nice spot to just sit and relax. Unlike the rest of Venice,
      there are a few benches here and you can also find a water
      fountain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Gallerie
      Accademia:</strong></h2><p>This gallery has art from the 14th century and
      is fascinating if you're a fan of Renaissance painting. <strong>Admission
      is free on the first Sunday of every month. Opening hours:</strong>
      Mondays from 8:15 AM to 2 PM (ticket decks close at 1 PM), Tuesdays-Sunday
      from 8:15 AM to 7:15 PM. (tickets decks close at 6:15
      PM).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Basilica Maria Della
      Salute:</strong></h2><p>A roman catholic church from the 17th century. It
      is worth visiting not only for its splendid Baroque architecture and
      treasures housed inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Bridges Of
      Venice:</strong></h2><p>Did you know that there are 400 bridges in Venice?
      Yes, that is a large number of bridges. I wrote a blog post to help you
      find these beautiful bridges.<a
      href="https://www.ourwhereabouts.com/post/beautiful-bridges-in-venice">
      Click here to read it!</a> I've included some tips on the famous bridges
      and added bridges that aren't popular. <strong>The most popular
      bridges:</strong> Bridge of Sighs, Ponte di Rialto and Ponte
      Dell'Accademia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Get Lost:</strong></h2><p>Last
      but not least, get lost in the city. This really is the best way to find
      hidden gems and explore Venice properly.</p>

    <div class="col-12 padded-left ">
      <p class=""><p>Alpe di Siusi is one of the popular locations in the Dolomites and for a good reason. It is a high alpine meadow, the largest high altitude alpine meadow in Europe and it is a really magical place to explore.</p></p>
      <h6></h6>
      <p><h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> You can either drive up or take the cable car. <strong>Car:</strong> If you're looking to drive up, do know that the roads are closed between 9am to 5pm, you can drive up to <strong><em>Compatsch</em></strong> before 9am or after 5pm. From there you'll need to walk about an hour to reach the most picturesque part of Alpe di Siusi (shown in photo). <strong>Parking:</strong> Parking is<strong> </strong>19 Euro (you can only pay for a full day) <strong>Cable car:</strong> If you're looking to take the cable car you can take it from Ortisei, Val Gardena. *Price: 19.90 Euro round trip.</p><p>*Hours: May to November from 8AM to 6PM. <strong>When to visit:</strong> Best to visit early in the morning and catch the sunrise or later to watch the sunset.</p><p><strong>Hiking trails:</strong> There are so many hiking trails here and it is very easy to spend a whole day here. Once you get off the cable car you'll have many options for different trails. Most the trails are flat and easy. We chose a circular trail around the Alpe di Siusi area which was <strong>5.3km long</strong>. We followed trail number 9 until the Schgaguler hut and Hotel Sole and followed trail number 6B until Sanon hut. From there follow the trail number 6A and 6B up to the Cotrin hut to return to the starting point and take the cable car down to Ortisei.</p></p>

      <h6></h6>
      <p><h3><strong>Things to do in Val di Funes:</strong></h3><p><strong>Hiking:</strong><strong> </strong>If you love to hike, there are a few great trails in Val di Funes. The most popular ones are: The Adolf Munkel Trail and the Alpe di Funes, Herrensteigrunde which is a circular hike and Ridge Trail. Sadly, we didn't have the time to do any of these hikes.</p><p><strong>Santa Maddalena:</strong><strong> </strong>A small village in the Funes Valley that's located 15 minutes away from San Giovanni church. It&rsquo;s a great place to start the excellent Panoramaweg and Sunnseitenweg trails that offer a gorgeous views of the Santa Maddelena Church.</p><p><strong>Santa Maddalena Viewpoint:</strong><strong> </strong>This is the most Instagrammable spot with the view of Santa Maddalena church and the famous Odle mountains in the background. Please respect the signs and do not walk on the grass there! We saw many photographers doing so all for the sake of a photo.</p><p><strong>Chiesetta di San Giovanni Church in Ranui:</strong><strong> </strong>Also known as Church of St. Johann, this place is Instagram famous for a good reason. It's a beautiful church surrounded by by green meadows, lush trees and Odle peaks behind it. Since this place blew up on social media people were trampling the meadow in front of the church, a field that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s private property. Therefore the owners enclosed the surrounding meadows and church by a large fence.</p></p>

The first 15 minutes are free, One hour costs 1 Euro, 2 hours costs 2 Euro, And 2-6 hours cost 4 Euro.</p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong><strong> </strong>Obviously the easiest way is by car but you could also take a bus from Bolzano to Val di Fassa and stop right at Lago di Carezza parking lot. How awesome is that?</p><p><strong>Walking around:</strong><strong> </strong>There's a small walking circular trail around the lake that takes about 20 minutes. It's a beautiful walk through the Latermar forest that surrounds the lake. It&rsquo;s a easy walk with a few great lookout points to view from different angles.</p><p><strong>Swimming:</strong><strong> </strong>Swimming here is not allowed since the lake is a protected natural landmark and fenced all around. Climbing the fence is prohibited. Why am I mentioning this? Many people climb the fence, take their awesome Instagram shots with the big rock without realizing this is prohibited and violators will be FINED!</p><p><strong>Drones:</strong><strong> </strong>It is prohibited to fly drones here.</p><p><strong>Food:</strong><strong> </strong>There&rsquo;s a restaurant and a caf&eacute; serving food, drinks, and souvenirs. The food and drinks were reasonably priced.</p><p><strong>Bathrooms:</strong><strong> </strong>Public bathrooms are available in the tunnel linking the carpark to the lake</p></p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-12 padded-left ">
      <p class=""><p>We almost skipped Seceda due to the weather predictions but when we woke up and saw that we were blessed with a beautiful day, we decided to go up. It quickly became one of our favorite spots in the Dolomites because it has a panorama that definitely stands out is so very unique. There are two ways to get up to Seceda, you could either hike up or take the cable car. I'm going to focus on the on the first option.</p></p>
      <h6></h6>
      <p><h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to get there:</strong><strong> </strong>The cable car to Seceda is called 'Seceda Valley Station' and is located in Ortisei, Val Gardena</p><p><strong>Parking:</strong><strong> </strong>Parking costs 1.5 Euro per hour or 8 Euro for the day. <strong>When to visit:</strong><strong> </strong>Best months From June to September (depending on the year, there may still be snow in May). To avoid crowds aim for September-October.</p><p>During the winter Seceda is used as a ski slope. <strong>Cable car: </strong>This is the best and easiest way to reach the top. From Ortisei, the cable car goes to Furnes and from there you have to change and take the Gondola to Seceda. You can purchase the ticket from the counter or online. Opening times may vary due to weather conditions, so you should check the cable car schedules before you go.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> 35 Euro per person return ticket, from Ortisei to Seceda and back (it includes both cable cars). If you'd like to take the Cable car up and hike down, a one-way ticket will cost you 25 Euro</p><p><strong>Opening hours: </strong>Winter Season (December to mid-April): From 8:30 and 16:30<strong> </strong>Summer Season (end of May to mid-October): From 8:30 to 17:30.</p></p>

      <h2 class="">Cadini di <span class="light-text ">Misurina</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 padded-left ">
      <p class=""><p>Most people who visit the the Dolomites hike Tre Cime, but there's an unpopular hike you must add to your itinerary called <strong>Cadini di Misurina.</strong> Cadini di Misurina has beautiful views throughout the hike. At the end you arrive at a very narrow viewpoint where you can get up close with these magnificent peaks that remind the mountains of Mordor in Lord of the Rings.</p></p>
      <h6></h6>
      <p><h3><strong>Things to know before you go:</strong></h3><p><strong>How to get there:</strong><strong> </strong>The starting point of the Cadini di Misurina hike is called <strong><em>Rifugio Auronzo</em></strong>, just like the Tre Cime di Lavaredo hike.</p><p><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Since it is a national park, you'll need to pay 30 Euro per car, at the entrance.<em> </em><strong><em>Remember:</em></strong> Bring cash because they do not accept credit cards.</p><p><strong>Opening hours:</strong><strong> </strong>The park is open between 7 AM - 7 PM.</p><p><strong>Starting</strong> <strong>&amp; End point:</strong><strong> </strong>Rifugio Auronzo. If you see everyone walking to the left you're going to want to walk in the <strong><em>opposite directions</em></strong> since Cadini di Misurina is less known and most are walking towards Tre Cime. The pathway starts from the parking lot.</p><p><strong>Bathrooms:</strong> The little hut at Rifugio Auronzo has bathrooms that cost 1 Euro. A little warning, the bathrooms are literally a hole in the ground (just like the bathrooms in Asia)</p><p><strong>Distance:</strong><strong> </strong>The hike is about 4km.</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong><strong> </strong>It takes about 1.5 - 2 hours.</p><p><strong>Elevation gain:</strong> The total incline is around 112 meters.</p><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Some will say easy and some will say moderate. <strong><em>I would say it is moderate due to the slippery gravel road at times.</em></strong> People will warn you that this hike is not recommended for those who have a fear of heights, it is VERY VERY TURE!</p></p>
